	abstract = {With the purpose of reverting the process of premature ‘de-industrialization’ suffered by the Brazilian economy in the previous decade, the Lula III administration has embarked on implementing a new industrial programme using a ‘mission-driven’ design. Several of the missions prioritised by Nova Indústria Brasil, officially announced in January 2024, will imply a greater demand for rare earths and other critical minerals necessary both for the energy and digital transitions, and the defence industry –integral components of the ‘neoindustrialisation’ objectives contemplated in the missions to be accomplished. Furthermore, in a setting of global great power rivalry and exacerbated supply chain failures, the quest for securing access to critical minerals away from China is offering Brazil, a country with large reserves of rare earths, additional prospects for linking production of these minerals to industrial policy. But how is the Federal Government responding to this opportunity for economic upgrading in its rare earths sector? The question will be examined by comparing Brazil's attempts at strategic management of rare earths over the 2010–2025 period within the context of President Rousseff's Plano Brasil Maior, the absence of industrial policy during the Temer and Bolsonaro administrations, and the recently launched Nova Indústria Brasil. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {In response to the decent work agenda in the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 2030, an increasing body of studies has focused on social upgrading in developing countries. Numerous studies have explored whether and how economic upgrading promotes social upgrading in various industries and regions. However, few studies have examined the employee social upgrading resulting from the upgrading in the tourism industry. Moreover, most existing studies have adopted a qualitative approach, with limited quantitative research exploring the economic-social upgrading relationships. Using data from a survey conducted in China in 2024, this study examines whether and how tourism industry upgrading promotes social upgrading among related employees, as well as the role of governance environment in this relationship, employing a structural equation modeling (SEM) approach. The modeling results highlight the significance of tourism industry upgrading in promoting social upgrading of tourism industry employees. Additionally, the local governance environment is found to significantly moderate the relationship between tourism industry upgrading and employee social upgrading. This study contributes to the literature on economic and social upgrading by providing empirical evidence from the tourism sector and emphasizing the importance of governance in facilitating social improvements. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The global value chain (GVC) approach offers valuable insights for resource-rich states pursuing economic diversification and enhanced resilience, due to its strengths in analyzing how policy shapes the tasks and linkages of state-owned enterprises (SOEs). By examining how state roles affect SOEs, we gain insights for diversification policy through economic upgrading analysis and resilience policy via a multi-level perspective. Drawing on the case of Kazakhstan before and after the shocks of the Russia–Ukraine war and the COVID-19 pandemic, we analyze two contrasting sectors engaged in GVCs: uranium, an advantaged resource sector where the sovereign wealth fund (SWF) owns the key producer, and medicines, a disadvantaged non-resource sector where a state-owned firm is the key buyer. Our upgrading analysis of pre-shock policies in the uranium case shows that a SWF-facilitated transformation improves diversification, while in the medicine case, policy interventions through the state-owned firm yield diversification limited to state priorities. Our resilience analysis of post-shock policies reveals that in both cases, state interventions created unintended consequences for the resilience of firms and GVCs, hindering GVC rebalancing and prompting strategic firm responses to mitigate adverse impacts. Our study suggests that state policies for resilience could better internalize these unintended consequences. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

The results indicate that (1) DIF has a significantly positive effect on high-quality development, which remains robust after conducting various stability and endogeneity tests; (2) DIF strongly contributes to economic upgrading in eastern regions, while its impact is weaker or even negative in central and western regions, revealing notable regional disparities exist; (3) a key finding is the identification of a double-threshold effect, suggesting that the positive influence of DIF only emerges when financial and industrial development surpass certain thresholds; (4) results from the two-regime SDM further show that spillover effects are more prominent in non-central cities than in central ones; and (5) mechanism analysis reveals that DIF facilitates high-quality growth primarily by promoting industrial structure upgrading. These findings underscore the importance of region-specific policy strategies to enhance the role of DIF and reduce spatial disparities in development across China. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Drought disasters have significant impacts on societies, economies and ecological environment. A comprehensive understanding of disaster-causing processes is essential for drought disaster early warning and prevention. This paper commenced with the drought disaster itself and categorized historical drought disasters from textual records. A framework that considered the linear and non-linear dependencies between droughts and disasters was developed. Nonlinear dependencies between droughts and disasters are recognized based on information entropy. The Driving-Pressure-State-Exposure-Effect-Action (DPSEEA) framework was applied for analyzing the factors causing disaster. A case study of China showed that the disaster was severe in the northern part of Northeast China, North China, the eastern part of Northwest China, and the southern part of Southwest China. The frequency of disaster in southern China exhibited an increasing annual trend. Central and South China had the shortest response time from drought to disaster, mainly within two months. In contrast, the western part of Southwest China and Northwest China had the longest time, concentrated in 9–12 months. Key factors of drought disaster were water consumption per 10,000 yuan of GDP, proportion of rural residents and GDP per capita. These findings suggest that disaster mitigation measures should focus on three areas: improving water-use efficiency, restructuring agricultural practices, and promoting economic upgrading. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {With so many states committed to economic transformation, and so many experts ready to provide technical advice on how to achieve it, why does progress so often remain elusive? In Pursuit of Prosperity examines the process of economic upgrading-moving to more valuable activities in production, improving technology, knowledge, and skills, and participating in global value chains-and develops a new theory to explain the form and success of national policies designed to promote it. Using a mixed-methods approach, Charles R. Hankla draws upon archival research and interviews from France and India as well as quantitative models of sixteen countries across six decades. He finds that when state and private actors are aligned in their institutional structures, which can happen in both corporatist and pluralist systems, industrial policy tends to be more effective. It is when the state or the private sector independently dominates industrial policy that poor outcomes are most likely. As In Pursuit of Prosperity shows, rather than being fixed characteristics of countries, policymaking styles vary across time and across sectors of the economy, reflecting the changing power dynamics and organizational resources of stakeholders. The book sheds light on how industrial policy-which is experiencing a comeback in the United States and beyond-can best be harnessed for upgrading. It offers a valuable contribution to our understanding of the complex relationship between state politics and economic performance in the modern globalized world. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This study investigates the multifaceted impact of tourism prosperity on high-quality economic development (HQED), advancing the literature beyond traditional growth paradigms by identifying direct, mediating, moderating, and heterogeneous effects. Using panel data from 30 Chinese provinces (2011–2022), we demonstrate that tourism prosperity significantly promotes HQED, even after accounting for endogeneity through instrumental variable, PSM, and Heckman selection models. Mediation analysis reveals that this relationship operates partly through industrial upgrading and infrastructure development, while the digital economy serves as a critical moderator that enhances tourism's transformative effects. Heterogeneity analyses further show that tourism's developmental impact is stronger in regions with higher social consumption, coastal provinces, and areas east of the Hu Huanyong Line—underscoring the importance of local market strength, regional infrastructure, and geographic accessibility. Conversely, the effects are more modest in low-consumption and inland regions, where economic absorptive capacity is weaker. These findings suggest that while tourism can act as a strategic lever for structural economic upgrading and quality growth, its effectiveness is conditional on regional characteristics. Tailored policy strategies that integrate tourism with local economic development, digitalization, and infrastructure planning are essential to fully realize its high-quality growth potential. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Participating in the global value chains (GVCs) has become an important channel for countries to achieve economic upgrading. However, it remains unknown whether obtaining higher returns from functional upgrading in the GVCs is conducive to equitable distribution of domestic income. This study explores the mechanism of functional upgrading in the GVCs on inter - and intra - national inequality, aiming to provide a basis for decision - making that enables economies to obtain higher value returns from different functional upgrading prospects and facilitates equitable distribution of domestic income. The findings indicate that, firstly, upgrading to the upstream and downstream functions of GVCs with the densest intangible assets is conducive to reducing the benefit gap between a country and other countries. However, the positive economic consequences resulting from successful functional upgrading in GVCs have not translated into more equitable income distribution within the country, which will lead to increased income inequality. Secondly, while focusing on production functions can help alleviate income inequality within a country, it can have a negative impact on the distribution of value among countries. Finally, from the perspective of the impact mechanism, GVCs power and effective structural changes are the channels that influence the relationship between GVCs functional upgrading and inequality among and within countries. To balance the contradictory outcomes of GVCs functional upgrading on inter - and intra - national inequality, policymakers need to design a multi - dimensional policy framework that ensures consistency between outward foreign direct investment policies, industrial policies, and global value chain governance policies. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

In the European Union (EU), ‘important projects of common European interest’ (IPCEIs) have become a template for a new, value chain-oriented EU industrial policy.

Based on the understanding that convergent development requires opportunities for ‘learning in production’ to accumulate the technological capabilities that are necessary for economic upgrading within value chains, this article advances an in-depth analysis of the implementation of this EU industrial policy template. It argues that IPCEIs have so far offered peripheral countries and their firms few opportunities for learning in production within value chains. In this light, there is a risk that IPCEIs might have limited or even detrimental effects on the prospects for convergence within the EU.

	abstract = {Many hybrid regimes are embracing economic upgrading as an engine of sustainable growth. Several of them have also successfully implemented economic liberalization while maintaining political stability. How do hybrid regimes achieve the goals of economic transformation and political stability simultaneously? I argue that one way they achieve this feat is by embedding institutional arrangements within partnership agreements between knowledge-based economic organizations and the state. Hybrid regimes grant these organizations broad autonomy to develop according to economic demands. However, when necessary, they can also draw upon these institutional arrangements to dexterously respond to shifting national interests. I apply this theoretical framework to international branch campuses (IBCs) in the hybrid regimes of Singapore and Malaysia. Leveraging archival materials, I examine the cases of Yale-NUS College in Singapore and the University of Nottingham Malaysia. I show that these IBCs have generally enjoyed wide-ranging autonomy in terms of course design and student activities. However, hybrid regimes can still activate institutional arrangements, such as state funding and mandatory course offerings, to (re)align IBC activities with dynamic regime needs. This research speaks to the political economy and political control literature to examine how hybrid regimes achieve economic liberalization without also allowing political liberalization. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Purpose: This study examines the impact of China's trade and foreign direct investment (FDI) on Africa's global value chain (GVC) participation and economic upgrading. Design/methodology/approach: The study covered 48 African countries, cutting across the western, eastern, central, southern and northern subregions to cover the heterogeneity of the continent. The study adopted feasible generalized least squares panel VAR-Granger causality Wald test and system generalized methods of moments techniques for estimation. Findings: Overall, China's FDI to Africa and US-Africa trade have a linear relationship with Africa's GVC involvement and economic upgrading. The findings suggest that although China-Africa trade has a positive impact on GVC engagement and upgrading, the marginal effect decreases in the face of US-Africa and EU-Africa trade. Originality/value: This study provides new evidence on the impact of China's FDI and trade on African economies' GVC participation and economic upgrading. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first study to empirically explore the effects of China's FDI and trade on Africa's GVC integration and economic upgrading as well as from the perspectives of backward and forward GVC participation. Furthermore, the study empirically examines whether the effects of Africa's economic cooperation with China relative to its GVC engagement differ from those of Europe (EU) and the US via a comparative regression. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Foregrounding migrant work in Dutch horticulture, it explores how technological innovation is connected to the scope and security of employment. Besides, it proposes a heuristic that connects workers’ experience to sectoral dynamics and the wider agri-food chain. Our analysis reads data from a small-scale qualitative study with different actors in the Dutch agri-food sector through the lens of the global value chain literature. Nuancing pessimistic predictions of widespread technological unemployment, we find product upgrading into high value-added products, and process upgrading, such as through climate control in greenhouses, to offer the potential for more and secure employment. However, higher work intensity and the dismantling of entitlements for rest and reproduction to ‘make people work like machines’ represent the underbelly of these dynamics. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The European policies that over the last thirty years have been carried out to address the economic problems besetting the Mediterranean space have not achieved their stated aim. Quite the opposite: not only do these problems persist but, like the south-north migration question, they appear to have no solution. The reason for this failure lies in the disconnect between the economic model the Muslim countries have been implementing since the 1960s and the model the European Union has been pursuing through its own policies. In fact, whereas the former model launched a process of economic upgrading inspired by the social contract, the latter has tried to set in motion a so-called “market fundamentalism.” Not only do the two models rest on incompatible principles, but they are also predicated on divergent ideas of economic growth and development. Because of this disconnect, the debate between the two shores has been marked by unilateral attempts to impose hegemonistic interests on one side, prompting defensive opportunistic behaviours on the other. Hence the lack of any positive interaction between the Muslim countries’ approach to the Mediterranean’s economic problems and the EU approach. In this chapter we will accordingly enter more closely into the reasons for this incommunicability and failure by examining the two different models of economic upgrading and the policies they envisage. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

However, this has led to ambivalent outcomes for catching-up. The Indian and Brazilian automotive sectors represent two industries in large emerging economies that have not successfully caught up to core countries, in contrast to China. In this chapter, we examine economic and social upgrading in the Indian and Brazilian automotive industries. We consider historically developed positions, industry characteristics and current key developments, including the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, companies’ strategies and the role of state programmes, particularly industrial policy—with a primary focus on the current key trajectory towards electrification. We conclude that India has achieved stronger market success and earlier electrification than Brazil, but has a significantly worse record in terms of social upgrading. In contrast, the Brazilian sector lacks substantial economic upgrading but shows historically developed strong social upgrading. Later in the chapter, we provide explanatory factors for these findings. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Purpose: In recent years, changes in global trade patterns, geopolitical instability and pandemics have greatly affected the security and reliability of global supply chains, highlighting the critical role and challenges of the logistics industry in the global economy. The logistics industry is large in scale and has the potential to provide support for future economic upgrading and transformation. However, China’s logistics industry still faces many contradictions, such as the imbalance between logistics supply and demand, under-utilization of resources and uncoordinated policy systems. These problems seriously constrain the further development of the logistics industry. Therefore, this paper chooses to take “Study on Heterogeneous Growth Patterns and Conversion Paths of China’s Logistics Industry” as its title, hoping to provide a little idea for policy making and subsequent research. The purpose of this study is to provide a useful reference for identifying heterogeneous growth patterns in China’s logistics industry and promoting coordinated regional development in the context of the dual circulation strategy. Design/methodology/approach: Firstly, the construction of the evaluation index system of the logistics industry and the use of the entropy method as an alternative to the subjective assignment method in order to provide a more objective and realistic evaluation and to reveal the development status of China’s provincial logistics industry through quantitative analyses. Secondly, a finite mixed model with accompanying variables is introduced. This method is able to classify the research object more objectively, thus avoiding the possible bias caused by subjective empirical grouping and uses the Poisson distribution to determine the affiliation probability of each path. Thirdly, the assumption of a constant growth pattern of an economy is abandoned, and a finite mixture model that reflects the path variation of the growth pattern of an economy is constructed. Findings: The logistics industry is a fundamental, strategic and pioneering sector of the national economy and is an important driver of economic growth. The paper introduces a finite mixture model to objectively classify the development level of the logistics industry. This is based on accounting for the development level of the logistics industry in 30 provinces in China from 2006 to 2022. The model also explores the heterogeneous growth patterns and path transitions of the logistics industry in China. The conclusions are as follows: (1) The development history of China’s logistics industry exhibits significant heterogeneity and may be characterized by three distinct sets of finite mixture models. The growth pattern is influenced by consumer demand, market environment and industrial structure. Additionally, regional location and business volume provide further explanatory validity. (2) The extent of government interference, the amount of human capital and the level of economic development are factors that can assist explain the likelihood that the logistics business will fall under growth Modes B and C. More precisely, the likelihood of Growth Modes B and C in the logistics business is influenced positively by government intervention, but adversely by the level of human capital. Conversely, a higher level of economic development decreases the likelihood of the logistics business being associated with Mode B. (3) Approximately two-thirds of the provinces have experienced path-switching over the sample period. The logistics industry is expected to follow a growth trajectory characterized by Mode B, followed by Mode C and then Mode A. (4) The results of the two-sided t-test indicate that the level of human capital has a greater impact on the degree of path-switching compared to the amount of economic growth. This paper provides a useful reference for identifying heterogeneous growth patterns in China’s logistics industry in the context of the double cycle and the promotion of coordinated regional development. Research limitations/implications: The limitations of this paper may exist in the following two aspects: Firstly, limitations in data acquisition: data in the logistics industry usually involves a large number of enterprises, but there may be differences in the openness and accuracy of the data in different regions and enterprises, and in particular the data of small and medium-sized enterprises may not be sufficiently transparent, which affects the comprehensiveness and accuracy of the study. Secondly, the impact of international factors: the increasing influence of global supply chain fluctuations and international logistics networks on China’s logistics industry, the study may be difficult to fully capture the long-term impact of international factors on the growth pattern of China’s logistics industry. Practical implications: This study can provide the government and relevant departments with appropriate data results. The Government can monitor and evaluate the data, which not only helps to identify the dynamics and changes in the logistics industry but also provides a timely basis for policy formulation. Originality/value: This study is an original work that aims to explore the heterogeneous growth model of China’s logistics industry and its conversion path. During the research process, I independently designed and implemented the research framework and methodology by relying on the relevant literature and data analysis tools. The data collection, model construction and conclusion derivation in the study are all based on my own analyses, without copying or applying existing research results and strive to provide new theoretical perspectives and practical basis for the development of the logistics industry. The opinions, conclusions and recommendations in this study are the result of my independent thinking. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

The findings are based on qualitative interviews and focus group discussions with various actors in GCVC. Our findings suggest two types of economic upgrading: process and product upgrading, achieved by smallholder producers and Abusa Sharecroppers in GCVC. While process upgrading is enabled by governance factors such as price stabilization and controlling opportunistic behavior, transparency in the sale of certified beans and premium management is key for product upgrading. Regarding the link between economic and social upgrading, we reveal that process upgrading leads to the same outcome of social upgrading and downgrading for smallholders and Abusa sharecroppers due to governance factors such as production and purchasing policies and lack of resources and capabilities. However, product upgrading links to social upgrading and downgrading for smallholders and Abusa sharecroppers respectively owing to governance factors such as controlling resources and bargaining power. We provide insights into key actors and their interests, drivers of change and effects of incentives that play crucial roles in shaping governance factors that influence economic and social upgrading of smallholders and Abusa sharecroppers in GCVC. In our conclusion, we identify how regulations, institutional support and conflicts of interest are key for enabling upgrading of developing countries’ agricultural value chains. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Middle-income economies must prioritise human capital development to ensure long-term sustainable growth and economic upgrading. While foreign direct investment (FDI) is believed to aid this endeavour, its impact on technical vocational education and training (TVET) remains understudied. This research explores the influence of FDI by multinational enterprises (MNEs) at various stages of global value chains (GVCs) on TVET graduate numbers in Vietnam and Indonesia from 2006 to 2016. Our findings reveal that greenfield FDI plays a role in shaping TVET supply, with heterogeneous effects across different GVC segments and subnational regions. Specifically, FDI in logistics, sales and marketing, and support and servicing are associated with an increase in the supply of TVET graduates in the region, whereas FDI in headquarters and production may lead to a decline in technical skills. To address these dynamics, public policies should prioritise flexible education systems capable of adapting to MNEs’ evolving skill demands. By doing so, these economies can elevate local human capital levels and avoid the stagnation often associated with middle-income traps. This research underscores the importance of aligning policy with the needs of a rapidly changing global economy to foster sustainable development. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

This paper, focusing on China, utilizes the coupling coordination degree and a panel regression model to shed light on the intricate interaction between social upgrading and economic upgrading. It is found that the coupling coordination degree of social and economic upgrading in China has improved from 0.33 to 0.49 since the mid-1990s, undergoing a shift from a stage of slight imbalance to low-level coordination. However, significant regional disparities are present in terms of economic upgrading, social upgrading, and their coupling coordination degree. Developed areas exhibit a higher degree of coupling coordination compared to less developed regions, indicating a connection between the coupling coordination degree and the level of economic growth. Economic globalization, public governance, and the legal environment positively impact the coupling coordination between social and economic upgrading, while economic privatization and corporate violations of law exert negative effects.

Existing knowledge, which is largely fragmented and descriptive, points to a number of uncertainties and complexities that make this process anything but linear. It is open question whether the deepening backward linkages facilitates forward integration in GVCs. Using data from 65 countries over two decades, we show that the impact of backward integration on forward integration in GVCs varies over time and that it is moderated by the level of development of the country, the diversity of the GVC partner network and the innovation conditions in the home market.

Design, Methodology, Approach-A discourse analysis of Qiushi and Renmin Ribao articles to identify elite signals on the role of China’s maritime economy within its maritime power build-up was combined with a qualitative, deductive thematic analysis of Chinese policy documents. Additionally, descriptive statistical analyses based on data retrieved from the Orbis and UNCTAD databases and the China Marine Statistical Yearbooks were used. Findings-The Chinese government has been actively signaling the importance of global value chains for the PRC’s maritime economy and has accordingly designed policy measures targeted at upgrading those global value chains. Quantitative data illustrates that, though the PRC’s maritime economy has grown, there is no proof of a completed upgrading process within its maritime economy. Practical Implications-Understanding how industrial upgrading enhances a state’s maritime power by accumulating resources and securing a central position in maritime production networks can provide policymakers with insights to strategically leverage these dynamics for national economic and security interests.

	abstract = {Bangladesh’s export-oriented ready-made garment (RMG) sector has experienced significant restructuring since 2013 after the post-Rana Plaza tragedy. A major focus of this restructuring is on the improvement of different aspects related to social compliances in RMG enterprises. This chapter examines whether the upgrading of social compliances in RMG enterprises in Bangladesh would be ensuring economic upgrading. Based on the nationally representative primary survey of RMG enterprises, this chapter observed better employability but reduced female participation, more demand for skilled workers, including female workers, limited wage disparity but higher wage dispersion, improved workplace safety with having safety committees and safety trainings, presence of workers’ participation committees but limited level of effectiveness and insignificant presence of trade unions. Overall, the social upgrading in the RMG sector is passing a transition period. Economic upgrading is observed in case of more corporatization in management practices, more direct engagement with brands and retailers, and growing use of advanced technologies in the production processes but limited progress in R&D, product development. The social upgrading in the post-Rana Plaza period is relatively higher compared to that of economic upgrading. Despite that, the relation between social upgrading and productivity is weak which raises the question of long-term sustainability of the social upgrading. This chapter suggests sustainability of the social upgrading will equally require economic upgrading through the use of advanced technologies, further corporatization, advanced level of training for female workers, and better industrial relations through effective worker participation committees. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {In today’s turbulent and complex environments, international business networks (IBNs) in various forms (e.g., strategic alliances, franchise chains, export and licence relationships, cooperatives, global production networks, joint ventures, public-private partnerships, and digital platforms) are becoming increasingly important in helping multinationals to achieve competitive advantage. Owing to increased performance pressures in uncertain environments, firms embedded in networks are increasingly moving from cooperators to collaborators as value co-creators. The aim of this introductory article is to discuss how IBNs may mitigate uncertainty (emanating especially from disruptive digital innovations and global pandemics) through value, configuration and/or knowledge-driven governance, strategy, and management. In addition, we provide an overview of the articles included in the special issue on ‘Governance, Strategy and Management of International Business Networks in Uncertain Times’ detailing their specific contributions to enrich the contemporary scholarly discourse in this regard. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Purpose: This paper aims to deepen understanding and knowledge regarding the impact of foreign direct investment (FDI) on the industrialization process. Many developing countries aspire to shift from agriculture-centric economies to achieve sustainable development through industrialization. Realizing this goal, however, has been challenging, prompting an examination of the sixty-year trends and effects of FDI on Tanzania’s industrialization trajectory. Methodology: This study employs a comprehensive approach utilizing time series models, specifically the Vector Autoregressive (VAR) model and the Error Correction Model (ECM), to analyze the dynamic influence of FDI on industrialization. By forecasting the five-year trajectory of industrial growth and FDI inflows using data from the Bank of Tanzania and the National Bureau of Statistics spanning 1960 to 2020, this methodological framework aims to provide a nuanced understanding of the FDI-industrialization relationship, contributing valuable insights to the economic development discourse. Findings: The study’s results highlight the significant role of FDI in shaping both short- and long-term industrial progress, which is critical to advancing Tanzania’s industrialization goals. Conversely, factors like exchange rates predominantly impact the short-term industrial landscape. Forecasts from the analysis indicate a projected decline in both FDI and industrialization from 2020 to 2022, followed by a notable upturn from 2022 to 2025. This underscores FDI as a key driver for integrating agriculture-based economies into global value chains, facilitating economic upgrading through capital accumulation—a fundamental catalyst for sustained industrialization. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The paper explores the political conditions favourable to economic upgrading in democratic non-corporatist emerging economies with a focus on CEE countries as characteristic examples. While the existing literature has assumed this polity type to be the least favourable for designing and implementing effective industrial policies because of a lack of bureaucratic ‘embedded autonomy’, the paper argues that this is not to suggest that such industrial policies and economic upgrading are rare in these economies, but rather that they involve different mechanisms of political mobilisation and support. To identify these mechanisms, the paper adopts a social bloc-based framework and applies it to an in-depth study of Estonia, a strong upgrader in the region in terms of its increased economic specialisation in ICT-based services. The paper finds that a lack of ‘embedded autonomy’ can effectively be supplanted by the embeddedness of private actors in the state administration and political decision-making through a network-based configuration of the social bloc and a shared upgrading ideology leading to a conflation of private interests with national development goals. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Using the Granger causality test and panel regression model, it provides empirical evidence and an explanation of the triad&amp;amp;amp;#x2019;s interaction based on the Chinese case study. It is found that, over the past twenty-five years from 1996 to 2020, China has seen a significant improvement in the coupling coordination of economic, social, and environmental upgrading with the coordination degree rising from 0.35 to 0.51, though it remains at a low level of coordination. Regional disparities in economic upgrading are more pronounced than those in social and environmental upgrading, and the inter-group disparities between economic and environmental upgrading have widened following the economic crisis. Panel regression analysis shows that economic globalization, public governance, legal environment, and environmental regulation positively influence the coupling coordination of the three types of upgrading, while economic privatization and corporate violations of law tend to have a negative impact. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Policymakers in Europe have embraced the notion that they can and should drive economic growth by promoting digital technology. Efforts to do so, known as ‘digital transformation’, involve reallocating labour and capital to more efficient uses, especially those that produce technological innovation. Recent research has shed light on the politics of updating institutions for education and skills training, but we know little about the politics of reallocating capital in the current episode of economic upgrading, despite the specific and sizable costs of producing technological innovation. What strategies are policymakers implementing to finance technological innovation, especially in Europe’s periphery, where states lack fiscal resources? Focusing on the case of Portugal, this article illustrates the centrality of development financial institutions to financing technological innovation, identifying a distinct type of digital transformation in Europe’s periphery, where the state plays a marginal role in governing key aspects of economic upgrading. Instead, private finance allocates capital, and international organisations like the European Commission design policies to govern capital allocation. This article develops a framework for analysing the politics of digital transformation in Europe’s periphery that centres transnational actors and institutions, rather than the state, in directing the path of technological and structural change. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This paper argues that the economic upgrading of suppliers in global value chains (GVCs) is influenced by the prevailing governance structures in supplier-lead firm relationships. Using a novel governance index for Philippine and Thai manufacturers, this paper tests if tight effective control received by suppliers can be detrimental to higher-order GVC upgrading. The unique 2012 Survey on Adjustments of Establishments to Globalization was used to calculate the index for Philippine manufacturers, while the World Bank’s Productivity and Investment Climate Study 2006–2007 was used for Thailand. The econometric results confirm that tight governance negatively affects upgrading in both countries. Specifically, the Philippine estimates show that tight governance has no impact on process upgrading given that: (1) all GVCs benefit from efficient suppliers, regardless of governance structures; and (2) process upgrading has relatively simpler technological requirements than higher-order upgrading. Tight governance significantly reduces the probability of achieving more sophisticated product, functional, and intersectoral upgrading, especially when this encroaches on the lead firm’s core functions. But since governance and control are necessary for efficient GVC operations, suppliers must conscientiously build capabilities and networks to move up the upgrading ladder. For weak-capability suppliers, innovation networks are important external sources of technology and knowledge spillovers. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

With its rapid growth in the last decade, the Philippines is char acterized as strong in voice and is expanding in the non-voice and more complex services sectors. Applying the IT offshoring services framework introduced by the Duke CGGC GVC, the analysis shows that the industry’s upgrading strategy could pursue the following trajectories: (1) upgrade from BPO to KPO especially in medi cal, financial, and legal; (2) expansion and upgrade within ITO; and (3) inter-sectoral upgrading to verticals or industry-specific activities particularly shared services companies, game development, and engineering services outsourcing. In upgrading in the IT-BPM GVC, human capital is a critical factor. Hence, the workforce and their well-being should be at the center of the country’s IT-BPM’s GVC strategy. Expanding into more knowledge-intensive BPO segments would require skills and workforce development covering not only good communication skills but also specialized qualifications in areas such as IT, engineering, finance, and design. One of the challenges that the Philippines faces is the lack of adequate size and quality of the country’s pool of professionals and graduates in business-related fields, medical and allied fields, social sciences, and engineering. Close coordination between the government and the industry would be needed in order to address the looming talent supply gap and implement educational reforms to better match the industry’s technical requirements. Government measures would also be needed in strengthening infrastructure support particularly broadband infrastruc ture, ensuring high-speed Internet connectivity and availability of power at reason able costs, and effective implementation of the intellectual property law. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The increasing consumption in developing countries poses a significant challenge to global climate change mitigation efforts. Understanding household characteristics is essential in exploring potential strategies to decouple carbon emissions from the increasing consumption. In this study, we utilized the multi-region input-output (MRIO) method to calculate household carbon emissions in China for the years 2012, 2016, and 2018. Using micro-level household survey data, we identified variations in carbon emissions among households with different economic levels and socioeconomic characteristics. Our analysis revealed that changes in household consumption structure and carbon intensity among households with improved economic levels, could result in a reduction of carbon emissions by 14 % to 19 %. Furthermore, households characterized by higher education levels, larger family sizes, and smaller housing units were found to generate lower carbon emissions per capita and per unit of consumption spending. By simulating household carbon emissions up to 2030, we identified three potential pathways to achieve decoupling: household economic upgrading, transitioning to low-carbon household characteristics, and reducing material consumption. Our findings indicate that even with a projected 75 % increase in per capita consumption volume by 2030, per capita household carbon emissions could still be lower than the levels observed in 2016. These results underscore the potential of consumption-focused policy measures in facilitating the decoupling of household consumption from carbon emissions. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Since sustainability is a growing concern, businesses aim to integrate sustainability principles and practices into product and supply chain architecture (SCA) design. Modular product architecture (MPA) is essential for meeting sustainability demands, as it defines shareable and detachable modules to facilitate assembly/disassembly and recovery. However, Traditional architectural modularity overlooks interface complexity and fails to balance commonality, complexity, and cost for effective facility sharing and ensuring ease of disassembly and upgradeability. Therefore, it is inefficient for economic design, modular recycling, and assembly/disassembly operations. Furthermore, the existing modular clustering methods cannot characterize components that may generate complex modular structures and decrease compatibility for remanufacturing and upgrading. Therefore, such methods cannot offer guidance on modular granularity to reduce premature product discarding through economic upgrading. This paper outlines a modular PFA and SCA by bi-level programming prioritizing sustainability. It emphasizes reducing product discarding and waste generation by focusing on lower remanufacturing costs and higher upgradeability in modular products and SCA. Here, the similarity of operation, ease of disassembly, and upgradability have been used for SCA with architectural and interface modularity. A fuzzy inference system (FIS) differentiates each product component and provides a basis for remanufacturing and upgrading compatibility. The developed leader-follower decision structure allows the selection of suitable and sustainable module candidates to share among product families, considering product architecture, processing activities, and upgrading opportunities. The designed case study on refrigerator PFA shows that the proposed approach saves 23.93 %, 7.21 %, and 17.2 % of SCA costs compared to non-modular, random clustering, and sequential approaches. Further numerical analysis evaluates the proposed model's economic, social, and environmental implications. Accordingly, the model is suitable for guiding modularization for financial gains while promoting environmental and social sustainability. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, production is configured around Global Value Chains, and countries’ involvement in those has become important objectives for achieving economic upgrading. However, social outcomes are neither equally distributed between countries, nor among social classes within countries. Indeed, GVCs and the potential gains of countries’ involvement in them, yield uncertain implications of the effects of globalization on inequality within countries. In this context, the aim of this work is to analyze the link between the performance of countries in GVCs (measured trough participation and position) and the levels of intra-country inequality. In more depth, we focus on Europe (specifically, EU28 countries), as it offers a wide and cohesive scenario of developed countries in which to test the effects of linking into GVCs on internal inequalities. We get a positive effect of participation in GVCs on increasing intra-country inequality, while more upstream positions are linked to decreases in income inequality. Besides, if we differentiate by geographical area, Western and Southern European countries would achieve higher reductions in inequality than Northern countries by moving towards more upstream positions. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), while balancing the three dimensions of sustainability, are latent about the pathways to achieve it. The transition may involve trade-offs between the different dimensions of sustainable development, like balancing the socio-economic dimension with environmental limits. The paper attempts to demonstrate some of these channels for the leather value chain in India, which is a conspicuous source of precarious labour and polluting industrial processes. Interacting the firm's objectives with value chain governance, we introduce four quadrants for the transition to sustainability. Combining voices from the field with a novel dataset, we provide evidence of the intersections between socio-economic and environmental sustainability illustrative of countries in the global South. The precarity of work and inadequate upgrading of the production process co-exist in most firms. We find that firms tend to hover around baseline economies of lower costs, work precarity and hazardous processes while exhibiting inertia for a transition. However, a few units are either transitioning or have nearly attained decent work practices and progress to cleaner technologies. The sustainability transition demands engagement in the social and economic upgrading of production processes and organisational practices. It is multi-dimensional, ameliorating precarious labour and upgrading to cleaner technologies. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Many farmers around the world are confronted with the decision of adopting high-yielding varieties or maintaining the diverse portfolio of ancient varieties and cultivars that constitute the basis of local and global agrobiodiversity. This dilemma often resolves towards ensuring short-term individual profits at the expense of long-term biodiversity conservation. In this paper we argue that specialty markets can act as a driving force to resolve this balance towards the conservation of agrobiodiversity, supported by collective action. We use the case of the Ecuadorian cacao producers to illustrate this possibility. The upper Amazon is the center of origin of cacao, one of the top traded global commodities. Since the 1990s Ecuadorian farmers have been substituting regional varieties with a clone developed in the country, the CCN-51 that has shown to be a high-yielding variety that is also resistant to monilia, a common cacao disease. In some areas of the country, however, farmers belonging to cooperatives have been able to keep local varieties, obtain ecological certifications for adhering to the recommended practices, and reach specialty markets that pay higher prices for their cacao. We call this set of benefits upgrading. We conducted a study of 205 household surveys and several interviews in four provinces along the West coast of Ecuador. We assessed the role of collective action (in the form of cooperative participation) in enhancing farmers’ access to high-value chains. Our results show that collective action enables economic upgrading by providing participants with higher incomes and more formal contracts. As farmers join direct trade and certification, other benefits are accrued, such as cacao and non-cacao tree biodiversity conservation. This analysis shows that, once niche markets are open for farmers, collective action boosts the benefits of such opportunities. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This paper examines the relationship between the industrialization pattern and the structural change process. This approach fits in a global economic context characterized by Global Value Chains (GVCs), which shake up the pattern of industrialization. In fact, by entering a value chain, economies are able to industrialize and export high-technology goods without building a broad set of industrial capabilities. Using a panel of 117 countries over the period 1995–2017, our three-step analysis, first reveals that manufacturing exports may not automatically bring about economic upgrading - measured by the transformation of the export basket. Secondly, the inter-sectoral approach demonstrates that developing countries, for which industrialization no longer seems to be the main source of continuous development, are specialized in ‘textiles and textile articles’ for the poorest countries and in ‘machinery and mechanical appliances’ for middle-income countries. Finally, the intra-sectoral analysis shows that both of these sectors can become traps leading to either sectoral concentration or product concentration with low domestic value-added, both of which hinder the continuity of the transformation process in the productive structure. We introduce the idea of an ‘industrialization curse’ to illustrate our findings. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Thus, this paper highlights the potential of urban design in the environmentally sustainable upgrading of Maputo’s informal neighbourhoods. This article aimed to develop sustainable and resilient urban design proposals and identify strategies capable of guiding the future process of physical territorial transformation towards a more sustainable model. Methodologically, a literature review was undertaken for the purpose of understanding the issues related to the theme and the general characteristics of informal neighbourhoods, as well as for exploring a case study: the George Dimitrov Neighbourhood. It was concluded that the current fabric of informal settlements possesses physical characteristics which facilitate the application of sustainable and responsive urban design strategies for the requalification of these deprived areas. Despite the marked difference between the spatial configurations of informal neighbourhoods and those of formal cities, it is possible to increase the level of resilience and sustainability of informal settlements through surgical and deep solutions, anchored on the particularities of the existing fabric. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

The household economic condition was validated by a report on deprivation and the presented growth of households' disposable income, exposing regional differences between the selected voivodeships. The populist party Law and Justice (PiS) won the two last elections, with the majority of votes in low-income regions, which proved the hypothesis that economic inequality, amplified by globalisation and transition disparities were the main reasons for populism's prevalence. The democratic backsliding has not changed party-political scenery for very long, which revealed that for the majority of Polish voters, economic upgrading counted more, despite the violation of democracy. Therefore, the advance of knowledge about measures to reduce the in-country socioeconomic disparities between regions has become more important. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

In order to study this relationship between GVC and economic upgrading, a micro-level analysis is performed based on recent firm-level data from the World Bank Enterprise Surveys (WBES), by analysing a dataset of firms active in several developing countries. Controlling for fixed effects, the results suggest that firms’ involvement in GVC has a significant positive effect on productivity. Firms that participate in GVC not only perform better, showing additional productivity gains, but also introduce new products. Nevertheless, sectoral evidence shows that this effect varies across industries, with a particularly negative effect of the interaction term in the textile and garment sector. Furthermore, the paper provides evidence that the positive effect of GVC is more pronounced for initially highly skilled firms. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {China's city governments compete to achieve or maintain importance in today's globalised economy. Corresponding governmental strategies seek to attract and retain high-skilled Chinese return migrants, a group that is expected to stimulate and carry forward economic upgrading. The cities'competition for those high-skilled return migrants is closely related to the development of high-tech development zones. In addition to industrial activities in the development zones, local governments create urban amenities by constructing specially designed living spaces as well as facilities in the development zones. Considering the tense housing situation in China, efforts to provide appealing and affordable housing solutions are considered a promising strategy for attracting high-skilled return migrants. Against this background, the article analyses, using the example of the two cities of Guangzhou and Dongguan (Pearl River Delta, China), two research questions: (1) What strategies do the municipal governments use to attract high-skilled return migrants - with what spatial consequences? (2) What are the most important factors and reasons for high-skilled return migrants when choosing their place of residence for resettlement? The empirical study uses a mixed methods analysis of government and media reports, secondary data as well as qualitative interviews with experts and high-skilled return migrants. Results show that despite the fact that both cities apply similar strategies to attract high-skilled return migrants, Guangzhou as a first-tier city remains more attractive to settle down permanently. The case of Dongguan's Songshan Lake Science and Technology Industry Park provides relevant insights into a prevalent municipal strategy for attracting high-skilled return migrants by providing indemnificatory housing solutions. The strategy of providing dedicated housing estates can lead to a tendency towards spatial segregation. Further, the authors raise awareness to the importance of underlying demands and preferences in resettlement behaviour when trying to attract high-skilled return migrants permanently. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Scientifically judging the environmental effects of embedding in the global value chain (GVC) has important theoretical significance and practical value, especially for emerging economies, but there are few studies on the relationship between GVC embedment and environmental pollution in emerging economies. Based on the classical theory of Grossman, this study analyzed the mechanism framework of GVC embedment on environmental pollution and then used the panel data of 16 emerging economies from 1998 to 2019 for empirical tests. After using the FGLS regression model and a series of empirical tests, the main conclusions are as follows. (1) The impact of GVC embedment on environmental pollution in emerging economies includes five effects. The scale effect brings about the expansion of production activities and increases the emission of environmental pollutants. The technological effect refers to improvements in the level of clean technology, which are brought about by the acquisition and acceptance of “technology spillover” in the value chain. The structural effect is the reduction in pollutant emissions and improvement in the environment through economic upgrading. The income effect is a “demand push” to improve the environment and reduce pollution triggered by an increase in national income. The lock-in effect means that the leaders of the value chain hinder emerging economies from achieving high-level economic upgrades, intending to lock them into the links with relatively high pollution. These effects are not static but are interlinked and affect each other. (2) The results of the empirical study show that embedding in the GVC initially has a negative impact on the environment, but with the deepening of GVC embedment, environmental pollution will decrease; that is, it shows an inverted U-shaped relationship. (3) The density of energy use, the share of fossil fuels, and the per capita income of emerging economies are positively correlated with environmental pollution, while population density and manufacturing share are negatively correlated. This study also provides suggestions on how to improve the environment in the process of GVC embedment in the future. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Given recurring evidence that low value-added activities tend to take place in low-income nations while high value-added activities take place in high-income nations, much of the Global Value Chain literature advocates for firm-level economic upgrading as a national development strategy. The key observations of SE extend to the GVC case. As such, SE provides GVC literature with a more appropriate social and political context and explains the inconsistent outcomes of economic upgrading strategies. Furthermore, the SE lens allows us to conclude that ahistorical analysis may be favored among economists to, consciously or not, generate an illusion of legitimacy to inequality between the so-called ‘Global North’ and ‘Global South’. Ultimately, standard conclusions from SE suggest a wealth distributive policy approach, indicating that a move toward reparations and loan forgiveness may be a more effective strategy for national development. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

A framework is proposed for analysing the priority stakeholders included in circular economy practices, their engagement based on circular justice literature and upgrading reached by them. Upgrading is understood as improvements or incremental innovation in terms of product and process, which is called economic upgrading, and also, environmental and social upgrading. Empirically, two case studies are proposed to elucidate the concepts. The first case is a waste management company specialized in electronic and electrical equipment. The second is nongovernmental organization from the fashion sector. The outcomes demonstrate that workers are the main stakeholders affected by circular practices with social inclusion. In both cases, there are indications of economic and social upgrading of workers. In terms of circular justice, the main result is the engagement of organization in recognition of rights. There is no evidence of distributional justice in both cases. Finally, the main SDGs addressed are no poverty (SDG 1), decent work and economic growth (SDG 8), responsible consumption and production (SDG 12) and reduced inequalities (SDG 10). © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Based on this, we analyzed the impact of the industrial transfer on carbon emissions for China’s 30 provincial-level regions during 2007-2018 using spatial panel econometric models. The results show a significant positive spatial correlation of carbon emissions, whereas the negative spatial correlation of industrial transfer gradually appears, and the local distribution of carbon emissions and industrial transfer is mainly characterized by high-high agglomeration. Furthermore, overall industrial transfer shows significant positive direct and negative indirect effects on carbon emissions. There are negative direct and spatial spillover relationships between industrial transfer and carbon emissions in the industrial transfer-out regions, while the industrial transfer-in regions show a positive effect. The transfer of industries, in particular, does not imply the transfer of carbon emissions; however, the balance of industrial restructuring and technological progress during the industrial transfer process can more effectively control and reduce carbon emissions. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Poland and Slovakia have an unfavourable GVC position and specialise in low value-added fabrication function. In contrast, other CEEs have competitive advantages in high value-added tasks: the Baltic countries and Slovenia in management services, the Czech Republic and Slovenia in R&D. We identify upgrading factors for different types of FS in GVCs. The wages convergence of CEEs with developed economies, and strong GVC backward linkages support the path to higher value-added in almost all business functions. Higher GDP per capita and lower economic distance to Germany allow CEEs to escape from ‘factory economies' status and also generate higher value-added in R&D activities. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

However, recent literature has highlighted that economic upgrading cannot be taken as a granted result of the involvement in GVCs, and it does not necessarily lead to positive social outcomes. We explore whether the recent performance of countries in the GVCs has significantly conditioned the intra- and inter-country inequalities. Using a combined multisectoral-multiregional (MRIO) and econometric approach, we analyze 67 countries during 1995–2018. Regarding involvement in GVCs, we look into “smile curves”, in reference to the quadratic relation between position and inequality. The results show different geographical patterns. For intra-country inequality, we find significant “smile curves” in Developed, African, Latin American, and Asian countries, so these can reduce internal inequalities by moving to intermediate positions in GVCs. For inter-country inequality, results suggest opportunities for catching-up in Latin America and Africa by specializing in the tails. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

This study selects the Pearl River Delta, where EU is prominent, to examine whether and how workers have benefited from EU process. The data used are from the 2012 and 2014 China Labor-force Dynamic Survey and self-conducted interviews, both of which cover measurable standards and enabling rights of workers. Based on the results of direct comparison and linear/logistic regression, this study argues that EU has a positive effect on social upgrading (SU) because state intervention and regulation play a shaping role in balancing the EU and SU. China’s state has achieved a good balance among its roles of facilitation, regulation, and distribution. Compared to SU on enabling rights, SU on measurable standards is likely to occur because measurable standards are easily quantified and observed and thus are at the center of workers’ occupational conditions at this stage. The state is inclined to pay more attention to measurable standards than enabling rights. The mechanism through which local states interfere with different aspects of SU considerably varies. Local states adopt flexible governance to strike the right balance between EU and SU. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {One of the most important challenges of the 21st century is the quest for economic development models that respect the planet's ecosystem. Rather than imposing our industrial systems on nature, why not let nature influence our industrial and innovation systems? From wind turbine blades to bullet trains and solar cells, many of the technologies we rely on today have been inspired by solutions found in nature. Although relatively widespread in the fields of architecture and engineering, biomimicry/biomimetics remains largely overlooked in economics, public policy, and development studies. This is paradoxical because the world's remaining biodiversity stock-a knowledge bank of solutions to both current and unknown challenges- is largely held in developing economies and can be leveraged as a source of inspiration for -and entry door to- industrial innovation. This paper, therefore, investigates the relevance of biomimicry in the formulation of sustainable development strategies in biodiverse developing countries and maps out the national policy landscapes that can advance it. Several findings arise from this study. First, despite the exponential growth of biomimicry as a field and our understanding of its economic impact, what drives nature-inspired innovation remains elusive. Second, the biomimicry innovation landscape is dominated by industrialised economies that have relied on proactive policy interventions, while virtually no developing country has adopted biomimicry as an innovation strategy, consolidating the exploitation of the biodiversity in the developing world by firms in high-income nations. Third, by drawing on empirical evidence from a selection of Latin American countries, this paper shows that while biomimicry presents tremendous opportunities to leapfrog towards high value-added knowledge-intensive activities by using local biodiversity and related expertise as factor endowments, policy, and institutional factors have led to the persistence of important coordination failures that hinder the expansion and commercialization of biomimicry-based R&D. This paper concludes by discussing the public policies needed to support the integration of developing nations at the innovation frontier through biomimicry. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {As economic globalization deepens, academic attention has shifted from the pattern and spatial organization of global production to the important participants of globalization: workers. Existing studies pay much attention to the added value and profits from economic upgrading in the process of globalization. Few works examine the improvement of workers' employment quality and social participation level brought about by social upgrading. In particular, there is a shortage of research on the relationship between economic upgrading and social upgrading. To further explore the relationship and synchronous process between these two and provide policy implications to help promote the type of upgrading that benefits the majority of workers rather than a small number of enterprise owners, this study adopts the entropy value method to comprehensively compare the characteristics of economic and social upgrading in the Pearl River Delta (PRD) region in South China from 2006 to 2019. It uses the improved coupling coordination model to quantitatively measure the coupling degree and coupling coordination degree of economic and social upgrading, and analyzes the factors affecting the coupling coordination degree based on several panel data regression models. The results are as follows. First, the process of economic and social upgrading in the PRD from 2006 to 2019 shows a fluctuating upward trend overall. The global financial crisis and the local industrial transformation in the region are important factors affecting the process of economic and social upgrading. Second, the overall coupling degree of the economic and social upgrading in the PRD during 2006-2019 shows a U-shaped evolution, changing from a high-level coupling stage down to a running-in stage and then up to a high-level coupling stage. Third, from 2006 to 2019, the coupling coordination degree in the PRD shows an overall increasing trend. This period saw improved coordination between the economic upgrading system and the social upgrading system. Finally, the level of regional human capital, consumption demands, foreign investment, and public governance have positive effects on the degree of the coupling coordination of economic and social upgrading in the PRD, while environmental pollution has a negative effect. This study contributes to the existing literature on social upgrading by integrating economic and social upgrading into the framework of regional development and revealing the coupling and coordination relationship between economic and social upgrading. The results advance our understanding of the relationship between economic and social upgrading and explores the policy implications for promoting regional economic and social development. Enhancing workers' human capital, increasing consumption demands, attracting global capital, and strengthening public governance are likely to stimulate the role of economic upgrading in promoting social upgrading. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

It argues that a better understanding of the causal processes of social upgrading can be obtained by integrating insights from labour geography, which situates worker agency at the intersection of a ‘vertical’ dimension of transnational relations and a ‘horizontal’ dimension of local relations, with conceptualizations of worker power from (global) labour studies, particularly the modes of structural and associational power. The authors call for a deeper theorization of the places in which GVCs ‘touch down’, arguing that worker power is decisively shaped by state–labour relations as well as the intersectionality of worker identities and interlinkages between spheres of production and reproduction. Case study analyses of the apparel sectors in Cambodia and Vietnam employ this reconceptualization, drawing on the authors’ own fieldwork. In both cases, worker power expressed in strike action was a key causal driver of social upgrading; and in both, the outcomes were conditioned by GVC dynamics as well as shifting state–labour relations and intersections of worker identities linked to gender, household and community relations. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The increasing pressures of global warming, population growth and epidemic occurrence are causing challenges in meeting the growing requirements for water, energy and food. In particular, the contradiction between the supply and demand for water, food, and energy is exacerbated by inefficient resource utilization and carbon emission increase. Incorporation of the interlinked aspects of water, energy, food and carbon emissions from agricultural systems into one water-food-energy-carbon nexus facilitates integrated resource management. Biochar application to farmland is a potential strategy for carbon management and agricultural productivity improvement. The integration of biochar systems and the water-food-energy-carbon nexus is an efficient and coordinated alternative method for sustainable agricultural management and a crucial strategy for addressing water, energy and food security issues. Accordingly, this paper proposes an approach for the synergistic regulation of water, land, energy, and carbon emissions in a circular agricultural system by balancing water supply and demand, land allocation, electricity consumption, and economic upgrading principles. A two-stage circular agriculture framework is constructed, with biochar and electricity generated from agricultural residues at the first stage and employed at the second stage. Economic-environmental-energy harmonization is considered in the methodology, and the agrotechnical potential of biochar is quantified via crop yield increase and greenhouse gas emission reduction functions. This approach can assist decision makers in providing the best policy options given certain agricultural resources to achieve the maximum economic performance of the system while minimizing environmental side effects. In this paper, the model framework is applied to the Sanjiang Plain in northeastern China to verify the feasibility of the approach. The results indicate that the external electricity demand is reduced by 87.8% due to the generation of biofuels. Cropland greenhouse gas emissions are reduced by 34.09%–67.06% via the application of biochar. This study proposes an optimization method with important implications for the improvement of regional cropland management techniques and development of sustainable circular agriculture. This methodology can be extended to other agriculture-centered regions with limited resources and environmental problems. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

To take the road of high-quality development, Tianjin must comprehensively improve the financing efficiency of leading industries, so as to speed up the cultivation of new growth points and form new driving forces. Cultivating and developing a leading industrial system requires support from technology, finance, management and other aspects, which is a systematic project with long-term development. The strength and efficiency of financial support is the basis for the healthy development of the leading industrial system and the key to the success of building the leading industrial system. Based on the actual situation of Tianjin's current economic structure, this paper deeply studies the impact of the degree of financial development on the financing efficiency of emerging enterprises in the leading industrial system. Through the Two-stage DEA Tobit empirical method, this paper studies the financing efficiency and influencing factors of Listed Companies in leading enterprises in Tianjin, so as to provide a theoretical basis for the research on the financing efficiency of leading enterprises, From the internal and environmental perspective of leading enterprises, explore the factors affecting financing efficiency, and give feasible development suggestions, so that leading enterprises can make rational decisions when choosing financing sources.

While the literature acknowledges that states matter in GVCs, there is little understanding of how they matter from a policy perspective. We address this tension between theory and practice by first delineating the state’s facilitator, regulator, producer and buyer roles. We then explore the extent to which corresponding state policies enable or constrain the following policy objectives: GVC participation; value capture; and social and environmental upgrading. We do so via a systematic review of academic GVC literature, combined with analysis of seminal policy publications by International Organizations. Our findings indicate that state policymakers leverage facilitative strategies to achieve GVC participation and enhanced value capture; with regulatory and public procurement mechanisms adopted to address social and environmental goals. Mixed results also emerged, highlighting tensions between policies geared towards economic upgrading on the one hand, and social and environmental upgrading on the other. Finally, we suggest that effective state policies require a multi-scalar appreciation of GVC dynamics, working with multiple and sometimes competing stakeholders to achieve their developmental objectives. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {It is argued that developing countries can now industrialise by inserting themselves into global production networks (GPNs), rather than by building their own value chains from scratch. The economic upgrading that would follow from such a move would result in social upgrading outcomes in terms of wages, benefits, freedom of association and collective bargaining would follow. Regarding the Indian IT/ITES industry, integration into the GPN has resulted in process upgrading and benefits to employees in terms of higher salaries, better working conditions and status mobility for employees; however, issues related to job security, social protection, working hours and work–life balance show shortcomings. Moreover, given that the work outsourced to India is at the lower end of the value chain, a highly educated workforce has been relegated to mundane and dead-end jobs in terms of employment. Thus, the gains from participation in the global economy do not seem to be effectively disseminated. Regarding enabling rights, the fear of reprisals by employers has made joining trade unions ineffective in practice. Further, global framework agreements relating to offshored work, commonly negotiated between unions and large corporations have been non-starters. Nonetheless, workers exercise their agency through their micro-level acts of resistance. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The Dead Sea area is draining massive tourism and infrastructure investments. However, the area is prone to both induced anthropogenic and natural geological hazards, with indicators requiring innovative monitoring. Hazards are resulting from the zone’s plate boundary tectonic setting and seismicity added to the generalized subsidence and sinkholes proliferation related to decades of accelerating water level lowering of this terminal lake. The Jordan Dead Sea Transform Fault System (JDST) is an N-S trending and ~ 1000-km-long plate boundary that accommodates ~5 mm/year. left-lateral slip. We focus on the main research results concerning the whole spectrum of destructive seismicity components, i.e. Instrumental, historical, archaeo and paleoseismicity. Field investigations in earthquake geology and paleoseismology point out the identification of seismic gaps with long-term temporal quiescence reaching 851 years on the Jordan valley fault segment compared to 988 years for the Missyaf fault segment of the JDST further north in Syria (as per the year 2021). Destructive historical and instrumental seismicity were subjected to careful robust revision processes. The repetition of seismic events and related earthquake faulting parameters suggest a high level of seismic hazard and risk along the JDST. From 1992 onwards, research based on space remote sensing techniques, Geographical information systems, and field data collection has been undertaken to develop a predictive model for salt karst hazards along the Dead Sea coast. Radar and optical image processing produced images capable of being interpreted in a geographic information system (GIS). The field observations were systematically georeferenced using a GPS and then imported into the GIS to be analysed with the processed satellite images. Each independent data source was used to establish an explanatory model for the prediction of areas at risk of collapse. This approach has been improved over time due to the arrival of an ever greater number of optical and radar images. Image resolution has also increased, allowing inventories of sinkholes, especially in the most dangerous locations. This Chapter contributes in filing the gap in the seismological, and remote sensing studies necessary to the sustainable preservation of this world class cultural heritage zone, the safe economic upgrading of the area and the safety of its inhabitants and visitors. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

It is one of the few comparative studies of the constraints and opportunities for social upgrading in global agricultural value chains (GVCs). We argue that the ease with which new suppliers can be found gives highly concentrated global wholesalers and retailers enormous leverage over smallholders. As a result, opportunities for social upgrading tend to be limited. Even in successful cases, it is accompanied by fewer employment opportunities. Cooperatives, which enjoy government support and enforced labor laws, are an exception. The chapter begins with a discussion of problems in measuring the impact of GVC participation and a theoretical explanation of why economic upgrading is not sufficient to ensure social upgrading. Special attention is given to the role of the state in promoting social upgrading. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Industrial policy is an essential component of China’s state capitalist economic system, and it is one of the main drivers for both China’s economic growth and industrial transformation that kick-started in the 1980s. China’s leadership has shown that it is capable of effectively employing means of industrial policy, ranging from artificially created demand to subsidies, to quickly develop and foster newly emerging industries. Drawing on the experience of China’s solar panel industry, this chapter explores the patterns of Beijing’s use of tech-focused industrial policy to spur economic upgrading with the example of an emerging industry that is of critical importance to the European economy: new energy vehicle (NEV) batteries. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {In the development process of the social era at that time, the concept of regional economic upgrading and development was in a very important position. Realizing the conversion of old and new kinetic energy to promote high-quality economic development is the focus of economic work at present and in the future. This study mainly discusses the upgrading and development of regional economy based on digital and intelligent innovation. Through the analysis of the influencing factors of the total economic volume and its growth rate, this study has a preliminary understanding of the development advantages and disadvantages of each district, county, and city in the process of regional economic upgrading. Through the comprehensive evaluation of the regional economic development of the province, it can obtain the distribution of the development degree of each district, county, and city and the comprehensive competitiveness of the regional economy. To sum up, a quantitative analysis has been carried out on the status quo of the provincial regional economic development. It uses a grayscale prediction model to predict the future of digital economic development, intelligent innovation, and regional economic development. The grey prediction model is a prediction method that establishes a mathematical model to make predictions through a small amount of incomplete information. Based on the past and present development laws of objective things, it uses scientific methods to describe and analyze future development trends and conditions and form scientific assumptions and judgments. The study found that province A ranked first in the comprehensive index of digital economy development. With its superior geographical location, it has become the vanguard of reform and opening up. It has been committed to the construction of the national digital economy innovation and development pilot zone and has achieved remarkable results, increasing from 0.6302 in 2017 to 1.317 in 2021. It ranks second in the comprehensive development index of economic growth. Province A increased from 0.4501 in 2017 to 0.8177. Province B ranks second in terms of the comprehensive digital economy development index, increasing from 0.5504 in 2017 to 1.1340 in 2021. Province B, with strong economic strength and prosperous trade, ranked first in the composite economic growth index, increasing from 0.4527 in 2017 to 0.8514. The upgrading of regional economic structure is an important way to achieve high-quality economic development in the new era. In the process of upgrading the regional economic structure, there are changes in factor allocation, resource consumption intensity, input-output efficiency, and environmental quality, which have a certain impact on economic development. This research will help to promote the process of regional economic upgrading and development. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Global value chains (GVCs) generate significant effects on participating firms. But can GVCs affect other companies in the host economies? We propose a conceptual framework for GVC spillovers and test it using data for Russian manufacturing firms in 2009–2015. Using a panel estimation technique with random and fixed effects, we find that firms in industries that are intensively integrated into GVCs, on average, have higher total factor productivity (TFP), controlling for firm heterogeneity, industry and region fixed effects. TFP gains in GVCs are unequally distributed and depend on (i) the industry’s position in the GVC, (ii) the industry’s technological intensity and (iii) the firm’s TFP level. We relate the findings to the evidence of the “optimal” technological gap that maximizes productivity spillovers for national companies. The results are highly relevant for policymakers as they prove that trade policy and foreign direct investment attraction policy should not go hand in hand but should be incorporated into GVC-oriented policy to encourage the full range of TFP improvements in local (non-GVC-included) firms. To fully benefit from GVC-oriented policy, State policy should encourage the development of inter-firm links. In addition, our results support the importance of evolutionary structural changes in economic upgrading in GVCs and the strength of the role of policies oriented towards medium-technology industries as drivers of technological development. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

A much-talked about feature of this configuration is the accelerated ‘trans-nationalisation’ of economic activities or the growing salience of, what are variously termed as, global value chains (GVCs), Global Commodity Chains (GCCs) or global production networks (GPNs). This paper maps the patterns of integration of the Indian Textile and Clothing, and Automobile industries with such trans-national networks. It focuses on the assessing the possibilities of social and economic upgrading within these networks. The thrust of the analysis shows that even limited gains of such deepening within such ‘chains’ or ‘network’ are highly uneven and inadequate. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Next, it analyzes how the enlarged scrutiny on this trifecta has influenced policy thinking in four leading trade narratives in which GVCs play a central role: the global value chain participation narrative which focuses on the importance of participating in GVCs to boost economic development; the resilience narrative that concentrates on the impact of global value chains on a country’s economic resilience against global economic shocks; the economic upgrading narrative that focuses on the fastest pathways for countries to increase their value capture in global value chains; and the sustainability narrative that focuses on improving local social and environmental conditions in global value chains.

The emergence of the digital economy has provided a boost to economic upgrading, but to give full play to the potential of the digital economy, we must have an accurate and full understanding of it. At present, the development of digital economy has become the focus of all circles. Digital economy is a multilevel and complex concept, so this paper establishes a multi-index comprehensive evaluation system and uses AHP-entropy weight method to measure the development level of China's digital economy and, on this basis, analyzes the development level, dynamic changes, and regional differences of China's digital economy. The results show that China's digital economy is on the rise, which is mainly driven by the construction of digital infrastructure and the application of digital technology. By region, there is a big gap between different regions in the development of digital economy, and this gap is expanding continuously. The digital economy in the eastern region is in a leading position, but only in the development of the digital industry. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Data for this study were collected through multi-sited ethnographic fieldwork in Ghana and Xuchang, China, between 2016 and 2019. This research shows that the ‘economic upgrading’ of the Xuchang-based wig businesses in the global production and value chain contributes to the ‘social upgrading’ of women’s status. New modes of global retailing facilitated by Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) and burgeoning E-commerce platforms enable women to exert more influence on businesses and start independent entrepreneurial ventures. Women’s affinity to fashion trends and the consumer base for wig products further gives them advantages of ‘capturing the gain’ in a buyer-driven retail business. As the wig businesses evolved from township-and-village enterprises to global players, collaboration and conflict in families manifest the contesting trends of contemporary family change in China: a tension between solidifying the importance of the family as a source of resources and the dissolution of traditional patriarchal norms in the course of ‘individuation.’. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Meanwhile, insertion and upgrading within global value chains (GVCs) deeply affect national economies in multiple ways. In this paper, we explore the research agenda on the distributional outcomes of the integration of countries into GVCs, with special attention paid to developing countries. A critical review of both the existing literature on the relationship between economic and social upgrading and the methodological approaches to GVC integration and their distributional outcomes are undertaken, in order to improve understanding and to help orient policy strategies. We highlight the relevance of institutions as well as the role of governments and MNE initiatives to ensure that the achievement of sustainable economic gains are translated into social benefits. This can be attained by the reinforcement of welfare and labour institutions, the strengthening of innovation systems, and support for and densification of local chains. There is a pressing need for further research on this topic founded on accurate knowledge of metrics and indicators for analyzing the insertion of countries into GVCs as well as their distributive outcomes. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Policies in four cities, Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen and Chongqing are coded and reviewed in detail to show the hierarchical and intersectoral policy coordination. The hierarchical analyses explain the responsibilities of the governments at each level. The cross-sectoral analyses reveal how domestic migration and housing policies are tightly knit together to support the local economic upgrading. The case studies of four cities show that the local policies are structurally aligned with the central guidelines, and the local governments adjust the thresholds for key indicators in the policies to attract or exclude migrants to reflect the local economic agenda and population control targets. This research showcases how the local governments in China try to balance between central mandates and local interests. The paradigm shift from pro-GDP growth to economic upgrading has clearly affected the local governments’ attitudes towards migrants. City authorities introduce selective migration strategies in response to the pressure to control population growth. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Social upgrading refers to the process of improvement in the quality of employment and securing basic rights of workers as social actors. It is an emerging hot research field of labour geographies in recent years. However, domestic human geography research has been mainly focused on economic upgrading with little attention paid to social upgrading. This paper fills the research gap by establishing a comprehensive index to quantitatively measure social upgrading and revealing the spatiotemporal pattern and driving factors of social upgrading in China since the mid-1990s, using spatial analysis methods and quantitative models. Main findings of the paper include: (1) Social upgrading in China was improved, with its social upgrading index increasing from 0.358 to 0.445 during 1996-2017. (2) The eastern coastal area is the main upgrading area, especially the three urban agglomerations of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, Yangtze River Delta and Peral River Delta. (3) Regional differences of social upgrading among the eastern, central and western regions were narrowed and the differentiation of development rates was alleviated. The central and western regions have been catching up with their eastern partner, despite that the coastal provinces will continue to be the leading areas for social upgrading in China. (4) Factors, including economic development, industrial innovation, economic globalization, labor skill level and state governance, have significant effects in driving regional social upgrading. The effects of these factors are not simply positive or negative in terms of their relationship with social upgrading, suggesting the complexity of social upgrading processes and global-local impacts on it. It is argued that economic growth does not necessarily bring about social upgrading. Rather, promoting social upgrading depends on the improvement in the quality of economic development. The paper contributes to the literature by providing a quantitative framework for analyzing social upgrading at the macro-level and advancing the understanding of geographical differences and driving mechanisms of social upgrading. The paper concludes by proposing some policies for promoting social upgrading and high-quality development in China and discussing its implications for future research. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Economic upgrading of local firms in developing countries is a central theme in research on global value chains/production networks. Within this literature, few studies have concentrated on upgrading in non-tradable services. Even when serving international business clients these tend to be understood as locally rendered, peripheral activities that offer limited upgrading opportunities. Using the facilities management sector in Mumbai as a case in point, this article argues that such a view overlooks how: (1) more sophisticated demands from advanced international business service firms lead to enhanced standards and economic upgrading in low-end, non-tradable services, and (2) the emergence of global support-service providers acting as intermediaries in global production networks (GPNs) has contributed to enhanced operational standards in low-end support services. At the conceptual level, this article aims to elucidate the capital and labor dimensions of economic upgrading. This allows for a better understanding of the variations in economic upgrading across sectors and the ripple effects of economic upgrading in places where GPNs are grounded. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {An extensive body of research has examined the prospects for suppliers in the global South to upgrade within global value chains (GVCs) controlled by lead firms from, and oriented towards end-markets in, the global North. However, the expansion of South-South trade has altered the geography of GVCs. Previous studies highlight key differences between North-South value chains (NVCs) and South-South value chains (SVCs). Much less is known about the multichain strategies used by suppliers who participate simultaneously in NVCs and SVCs, and how these affect their prospects for economic upgrading. This article draws on the case of Kenyan horticultural suppliers to explore the implications of multichain strategies for economic upgrading, in terms of value-added tasks (product diversification and product sophistication) and economic returns (unit values). We adopt a mixed-methods approach combining transaction-level customs data for the 2006–2018 period with supplier interviews. We find that suppliers adopting multichain strategies experienced significantly more product diversification and higher economic returns than suppliers operating only in NVCs or SVCs, yet results for product sophistication are insignificant. Our results are robust to the use of multilevel linear regressions (MLRs), propensity score matching (PSM), and two-step system-GMM. The article highlights a critical need for GVC research to account for the multichain strategies of suppliers serving multiple and overlapping value chains, and their implications for economic upgrading. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Although it is known that returnee entrepreneurs can contribute to technological and economic upgrading in their home countries, there is also evidence of a returnee liability where returnee entrepreneurs perform worse than locals. Apart from mismatches between home and host country institutional environments, this liability is argued to stem from interpersonal factors like cultural difficulties and the diminished social capital of returnees at home. Using interviews exploring the experiences of twenty Nairobi-based technology-enabled returnee entrepreneurs, we theorize the micro-foundations of the returnee liability: mismatched expectations, cultural tension and mutual suspicion. Returnees who sent remittances while abroad expect locals to support their return and entrepreneurial vision, but locals expect continued financial support. Returnees who had become more individualistic while fending for themselves in Western economies experience tension with the collectivism of locals, even while they seek to readjust to their home culture. The suspicion of returnees about unethical local business practices and frustration about locals’' apparent inability to value proposed innovations further complicate the ability of returnees to access local knowledge and networks. We discuss how the community support addresses these micro-foundations of the returnee liability and thus help developing countries better benefit from the knowledge and innovations of their returnees. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Research background: High servitisation of manufacturing makes it impossible to separate services from manufactured goods properly, which implies difficulties in the assessment of the position of the country on the smile curve, i.e. in the proper assignment of products or services to one of the industrial process steps: pre-production, pure fabrication or post-production services. Therefore, we propose to use the business functions of industries identified with the aid of labour market data rather than the industrial classification of products in order to create a more appropriate measure of the position of countries in GVCs. Purpose of the article: We aim to identify and analyse the patterns of functional specialisation for eight Central and Eastern European Countries (CEECs) - the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia - both at the country and industry level. In addition, we analyse functional specialisation patterns for Germany, which serves as a reference country. Methods: To assess functional specialisation patterns, we employ the methodology proposed by Timmer et al. (2019a). It allows us to obtain functional specialisation indices for four different business functions - management, R&D, marketing, and fabrication. To compute them, we combine two sources of data - domestic value added from decomposed sectoral input-output tables (the World Input Output Database) and the Occupations Database built up by Timmer et al. (2019a). Findings & value added: Our research shows a very heterogeneous pattern in CEEC countries' position in GVCs by taking into account their functional specialisation at the countries and industries levels. Poland and Slovakia focus primarily on low value-added fabrication processes, the Baltic countries and Slovenia specialise in management services, Hungary and Latvia gain in marketing services, and the Czech Republic and Slovenia win in R&D activities. We indicate that some CEE countries (Poland, Slovakia) could be stuck in a functional trap, and our approach could be a valuable tool for assessing the process of coming out of it. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The regulation of employment in global value chains (GVCs) is a story of the interaction of corporation and state in transnational space, where uneven international development has allowed the commodification and exploitation of international labour. Global standards are well articulated by bodies such as the International Labour Organization (ILO) and UN. We know what ‘decent work’ should look like as well as what all workers should enjoy as basic employment and human rights. Yet, internationally, the different mechanisms of private and public regulation fail at the point of implementation and across the world we see no fundamental shift in the condition of labour in terms of its capacity for social or economic upgrading. This article examines the regulatory mechanisms, and outcomes of regulation, of industrial relations in GVCs. It commends a future research agenda to illuminate the interaction between different sources of standards and rules and the complexities of intersecting private and public regulation, in the pursuit of enforceable, meaningful regulation of work and employment in international supply chains. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Using the Least Square Dummy Variable (LSDV) technique, the results showed that regional economic integration is not a significant driver of the economic upgrading of their Members, in GVCs but one-period lagged backward participation in GVCs is. Considering labour productivity as an alternative measure of productivity in the place of productivity linked with participation in GVCs (economic upgrading), regional economic integration turned out to be a weak positively significant determinant. At a disaggregated level, regional economic integration significantly determined labour productivity in both EAC and SACU but not in ECOWAS.

As a result, opportunities for social upgrading tend to be limited. Even in successful cases, it is accompanied by fewer employment opportunities. Cooperatives, which enjoy government support and enforced labor laws, are an exception. The article begins with a discussion of problems in measuring the impact of gvc participation and a theoretical explanation of why economic upgrading is not sufficient to ensure social upgrading.

The rights consolidated in legislation and the institutions established were the result of workers using their power in strategic ways.

First, learning from advanced market economies through entrepreneurs, laborers, and government officials is essential for economic upgrading. Second, to achieve effective and sustainable learning, the process of opening up must be carefully managed and paced. In other words, opening up in one fell swoop will not bring long-term growth and prosperity to an economy. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This chapter explores knowledge-acquisition strategies adopted by Bangladeshi garment suppliers, in pursuit of economic upgrading. The context is characterised by ‘tacit promissory’ contracting relationships, whereby suppliers make recurrent discrete transactions with the same buyers over a long period of time, without the existence of any original and legally binding written agreement. We explore whether and to which extent suppliers in such contexts can access the knowledge resources of their powerful trading partners. Furthermore, we examine the strategies these supplier firms may pursue, at a functional level, to compensate for their lack of knowledge in order to effectively progress towards upgrading. We draw on a qualitative case analysis of two small and two large Bangladeshi garment manufacturing firms. The findings show that these suppliers source knowledge externally to the extent to which these are available and affordable to them, in order to compensate for the lack of access to buyers’ tacit knowledge resources. The small firms in our study are only able to seek locally available knowledge sources, and thus are constrained to technocratic or output-oriented dimensions of process upgrading. Large firms, however, are able to afford sourcing tacit and codified components of knowledge from overseas and thus arrive at higher order functional capabilities including designing and branding. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

For this reason, this research designs a supply chain resource distribution allocation model based on deep learning. Select the indicators of the supply chain resource distribution allocation model to determine the principle of resource input, risk compensation, maximum utility and comprehensive optimization. Then construct the objective function of supply chain distribution configuration according to the cost and benefit requirements, and then use deep learning technology to obtain the optimal solution of the objective function scheme.

	abstract = {To tackle internal and external challenges, the Chinese government has made great efforts to promote economic upgrading, but little scholarly attention has been paid to its social consequences. Previous studies have found that economic restructuring is often associated with economic shock and industry shift, noting that social upgrading does not automatically follow economic upgrading, and workers can become economic victims. Given China’s individual rights-based labour regulatory framework, it is necessary to explore workers’ individual strategies to tackle economic restructuring. In light of this, this study analyses how migrant workers in the Pearl River Delta cope with economic restructuring. Interviews were conducted with 72 participants, including migrant workers, scholars, employers and officials. The interviews revealed that to deal with the pushing-out effect of economic restructuring, migrant workers often use strategies of individual resistance, re-employment, skill upgrading, reducing living costs, migrating to other cities, and returning to farming. Policy recommendations are proposed accordingly. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

The result shows that (1) although the development of logistics industry in different regions is extremely uncoordinated, the logistics efficiency of the provinces along the Maritime Silk Road is higher than that of the provinces along the Land Silk Road; (2) in contrast, the capital factors contribute more to the added value of the logistics industry along the territory regions of the Belt and Road Initiative; (3) as far as the influencing factors of logistics efficiency are concerned, regional economy, location advantage and higher education level have significant promotion effect on the logistics efficiency of the regions the route, but the technological progress has no obvious effect on the logistics efficiency. Finally, according to the efficiency result, it is suggested that (1) the provinces along the Maritime Silk Road should continue to deepen reform, expand opening up and promote the development of logistics industry with strong economic strength, in which Shanghai should vigorously improve the development quality of logistics industry, and Hainan should expand foreign trade to expand the scale of logistics industry; (2) the provinces along the Land Silk Road should speed up regional economic upgrading and growth, improve infrastructure construction, and use the Belt and Road Initiative to deepen foreign economic and trade cooperation and attract investment, improve the logistics efficiency of the regions along the route through a package of projects, and ultimately promote the smooth implementation of the Belt and Road Initiative. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {For aquaculture to continue along its current growth trajectory and contribute towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, value chains must become more inclusive. Smallholders and other local value chain actors are often constrained by circumstances and market failures in the global aquaculture industry. Integrating these actors into aquaculture value chains through inclusive business models (IBMs) is often touted as a solution to sustainable and ethical trade and business that can generate development outcomes. We reviewed 36 papers under seven business models commonly used in agriculture development to assess their application in aquaculture value chains in lower-income countries. A global value chain (GVC) analysis is used to unpack the economic and social upgrading objectives of the different IBMs, as well as the types of relational coordination used between actors in the chain to achieve development outcomes. The extent to which these IBMs helped poor actors overcome certain barriers is evaluated with a focus on how they may ensure or be a risk to inclusiveness through the relations and upgrading opportunities evident in their make-up. The analysis found that the majority of the models focused on economic upgrading over social upgrading. Providing opportunities for the latter is key to achieving the inclusive objectives of IBMs. Greater horizontal coordination between actors can create further opportunities for economic upgrading established under vertical coordination with other nodes upstream and downstream in a value chain. There is a need to further contextualize these models to aquaculture systems and develop clear indicators of inclusiveness. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Research Summary: Researchers have tried to understand how insertion into global value chains (GVCs) can lead to economic upgrading for the developing country firms (DCFs) involved. Many of these studies operationalize upgrading as a DCF's movement into higher value-added activities, where the creation and appropriation of value-added are assumed to be symbiotic. In doing so, they divorce economic upgrading from its effect on interfirm bargaining power. We address this core assumption by introducing insights from theories on power-dependence relations. We argue that pursuing an economic upgrading trajectory can be positioned a necessary but insufficient condition for DCF value-added appropriation. In so doing, we theoretically explicate the conditions under which an economic upgrading trajectory is likely to result in DCF value-added capture. Managerial Summary: The fragmentation and dispersion of the multinational enterprises' (MNE) value-adding activities allows DCFs to insert themselves in the MNEs' value chain. Within both academic and policy spheres, DCFs are encouraged to participate in GVCs as it allows for knowledge and resource transfers from the MNE (upgrading opportunities). In this paper, we offer a critique on this notion of economic upgrading. We argue that researchers have focused on the benefits that new or improved value chain activities can bring, but have largely ignored how these benefits are shared between the chain participants OR members. We address this assumption by introducing power-dependence and bargaining power to explicate the conditions under which an economic upgrading trajectory can positively influence the DCF's value-added appropriation. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

And when does foreign direct investment (FDI) result in local upgrading? Using a study of FDI and global value chain participation in Dongguan, China, we find a mechanism in which FDI results in sustained local economic upgrading and improved MNE subsidiary performance: a collaborative public space (CPS). A CPS is a social space based on trust that enables different and divided actors to engage, sharing concerns and information in ways that they otherwise would be disinclined to consider. Using the CPS concept, we expand understanding of the effectiveness of MNE strategies in host-country environments and the conditions in which FDI leads to change in global value chains. Managerial Summary: The international strategy literature has found that FDI has ambiguous impacts on host-country regions and firms, leading in some cases to upgrading or in others to local firm deskilling or decline. It has also shown that the postinvestment strategies of MNEs, particularly political connections or business associations, have mixed results. Using the concept of a CPS, we show how the construction of a trust-based social space can improve MNE subsidiary and local firm performance and lead to changes in the structure and composition of global value chains (GVC). The GVC changes by incorporating new host-country suppliers and buyers as well as increasing the value-added, thus creating a new node and exchange patterns in the GVC. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This article examines whether low-income countries can still benefit from participating in manufacturing global value chains (GVCs) in terms of broader industrial development in a global context of greater competition and higher requirements. It contends that developing internationally competitive local firms and domestic linkages, in addition to upgrading, is crucial for participation in GVCs to drive industrialization. The study focuses on Ethiopia's recent experience with developing an apparel export industry through strategic industrial policy. Based on original empirical data collected through firm-level surveys and interviews with government officials, industry experts and buyers, the article analyses the upgrading and localization trajectories of foreign and local apparel-exporting firms. It argues that value-capture benefits in assembly positions in apparel GVCs have become more difficult. The potential for localization benefits depends on the type of global buyers and foreign producers and their levels of embeddedness, but whether this potential is realized also depends on local firm characteristics and related industrial policy. Ethiopia's industrial policy has been relatively successful regarding national economy linkages, but less successful in developing competitive local export firms due to a weak local manufacturing tradition combined with a global context that has led to a supplier squeeze. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Market incentives, vertical relationship management and increasing pressure for certified and standardized products has pushed mango farms in Pakistan to acquire certifications like Global GAP.

Double-log regression model is used to assess the effects of decent work agenda and its effect on social upgrading of workers both at Global GAP certified and traditional non certified orchards in Southern Punjab and Sindh. Since the certified orchards are driven by the global value chain system under the food safety and quality standards, they have more potential and prospective to improve the livelihood of the on-farm workers. Education included as schooling years was found major regressor for the income of on-farm laborers. In ceteris paribus conditions, coefficient of education indicates that there is a positive relationship among education of labor and Income.

	abstract = {Purpose: Public policy to promote corporate social responsibility (CSR) can be a tool used by the state to promote the creation of social value by multinational enterprises (MNEs) and their global suppliers. Yet, this aspect has been little explored in the literature on social value creation in international business. While there is a substantial literature on the interactions of public and private regulation of firm behaviour in the global economy, little is known about the emergence of local institutional environments aimed at creating social value from MNE activities. This paper aims to address this gap in the literature. Design/methodology/approach: Conceptually, the paper draws on the literatures on global production networks (GPNs) and on institutional approaches to CSR to grasp the local institutional environment for social value creation in MNEs and their suppliers. Empirically, the case of China is examined based on a review of literature, policy documents and interviews. The key questions the paper seeks to address is as follows: How can the emergence of local Chinese CSR standards be explained? How does the emergence of such CSR standards fit into wider policy objectives in the context of Chinese export-oriented growth? Findings: The paper argues that the emergence of CSR standards in China needs to be seen in the context of changing industrial policy objectives to enhance both the social and economic value of participation in GPNs. Specifically, the evolution of Chinese CSR standards corresponds to a shift from structural towards functional coupling in GPNs, associated with increased policy attention on enhancing local skills and technology. Taking the case of the textile and apparel sector as an example, the paper illustrates how the adoption of China’s first CSR management system has taken place in a context of shifting strategic coupling objectives. Research limitations/implications: A lack of data does not allow any conclusions on the impact of the Chinese institutional environment on social value creation and economic upgrading at firm level. This question could be addressed in further research. In addition, the findings open new questions around possible synergies between local policies and MNE efforts on sustainability. Increasing cooperation between Chinese and international standard setters around CSR opens the question of whether this leads to a convergence of horizontal and vertical governance on sustainability in the apparel GPN. Practical implications: Findings show that there may be a window of opportunity for international practitioners to seek further dialogue with Chinese actors around promoting socially and environmentally sustainable business in a global economy. Originality/value: The paper contributes to a better understanding of changes in the institutional environment for social value creation for MNEs and their suppliers in a key emerging economy. It illustrates how institutional approaches to CSR and the GPN framework can be combined to grasp the institutional environment for social value creation in an international business context. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Kenya and Uganda are currently two of the fastest growing countries in the East African Community. The political leaderships' prioritization of sociopolitical and economic development, combined with the wish for a closer integration into the world market, shifted the countries' governance structures and agenda setting. Undertaken economic projects, including oil explorations, mining and gold extractions, flower farming and intense rice growing, put conservation areas at great risk and led to a decrease of the country's wetland and forest cover. Accordingly, the impact of climate change on the vulnerability of countries is increasing. The paper critically investigates how particularly recent economic investments by national and international companies question the coherence between the institutional framework on climate policies, especially on a sub-national level of decision-making. Based on two field visits to the area, this paper raises the question of how the institutional frameworks shape climate governance processes in Kenya and Uganda. Looking at both political and climate governance structures from a pragmatic perspective, this paper concludes that the insufficient implementation of existing governance structures hampers the better integration of climate policies. National actors do not consider climate financing as an important issue which results in the fragmentation and undermining of climate policy processes. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The Global Value Chains/Global Production Networks (GVC/GPNs) literatures have become the predominant international political economy frameworks to understand the challenge of economic upgrading under 21st century globalization. However, until recently, this literature has overlooked the role of the state (outside its regulatory responsibilities) and the explanatory power of domestic political economy. Meanwhile, literature on developmental states, industrial policy and political settlements has generally taken a methodologically nationalist perspective to examine economic transformation in developing countries. This article uses insights from the political settlements literature to contribute to the growing agenda within the GVC/GPNs literature to examine how the role of the state and domestic politics shape upgrading pathways in developing countries. Using the example of the Rwandan government’s attempts to increase specialty coffee exports over the last two decades, the article shows how the public governance of the domestic value chain, combined with governance dynamics in the coffee GVC/GPN, has shaped upgrading pathways in Rwanda’s coffee sector. By developing a domestic political economy approach within the GVC/GPN tradition, this article contributes to the growing attention within international political economy to focus on how multi-scalar pressures are shaping the outcomes of economic policy in developing countries. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

However, to date there is no valid measure of firm-level upgrading, making it hard to systematically measure and address deficiencies within firms to enhance firms’ performance and national economic development. This paper addresses this gap by developing and validating measures of four types of economic upgrading using data from senior executives (n = 350) in Bangladeshi apparel supplier firms. The resulting measures have reliability, convergent and discriminant validity as well as nomological validity. The findings of the assessment of nomological validity suggest that suppliers’ manufacturing capability is critical to all four types of upgrading. The four types of upgrading, however, have differing impacts on supplier firms’ production and export performance. Suggestions as to how these measures can be used in practice, policy and research to better understand and manage firm-level upgrading are provided. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

It also provides reflections on the governance of work and recommendations for gender-inclusive policies, showing that industrial hubs and GVCs can provide a path of economic upgrading for developing countries, but that only when that process is paired with social upgrading for women workers, will overall development gains be attained. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

However, evidence suggests that these economic outcomes are gained at the cost of labourers' poor working conditions. This research contributes to existing literature on GVCs by investigating the influence of different governance structures on economic and social upgrading of firms participating in GVCs. Furthermore, the research attempts to understand the relationship between economic and social upgrading in GVCs. Research design and methodology: Detailed qualitative primary research was carried out in the football industry of Sialkot, Pakistan. The case study approach was employed, and football firms were the unit of analysis. Semi-structured interviews with firms' representatives were conducted. Results: Findings reveal that most firms were found in captive, relational and market governance structures. Furthermore, product and process upgrading were witnessed in all firms; however, social upgrading was observed mostly in captive and relational GVCs. Moreover, social upgrading was linked to economic upgrading in captive and relational networks. Conclusions: The findings from the Sialkot football industry reflect that buyers pay higher prices and margins to their suppliers once they upgrade their products and processes. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

The author shows how economic upgrading in De Doorns has been accompanied by social downgrading. She explains that the ability of the state to increase the minimum wage for farmworkers is constrained by the unequal distribution of bargaining power between domestic fresh-fruit producers and retailers from overseas: the former cannot increase their value capture, but this would be necessary to compensate for substantially higher wages, as demanded by farmworkers.

Looking at the interplay between economic and social upgrading, there is significant evidence across different sectors that while economic upgrading may lead to social upgrading, this is not automatically the case.

	abstract = {Since 2018, a political campaign to integrate leadership by the Communist Party as the core force in corporate governance in China has reversed the course of market reform in the past 40 years, which was predicated on separation of the Party’s political functions from company business operations. This article critically reviews the trend of developments from a historical perspective and analyses the impact of the political campaign on China’s socialist market economy and rule of law conditions. Some institutional implications are also examined in the comparative context with reference to the OECD Corporate Principles.

	abstract = {This paper describes and analyzes the current state of the electronics industry in Indonesia. It analyzes the close links between economic and social upgrading in the Global Value Chain (GVC). Previous studies, have mostly focused on finding ways to improve the economy, while the social issues have not been addressed. Economists have found that an increase in FDI and exports indicates industrial development and a deeply integrated GVC. This is called economic upgrading. Furthermore, economists believe that increasing in workers’ salaries and allowances to improve workers’ living standards indicates social upgrading. The electronics industry is among the few industries that have become Indonesia’s top priority in industrial development until 2025. Furthermore, it is the main international trade activity in most countries of ASEAN and East Asia. The paper uses the parsimonious measurement approach that refers to economic and social indices comprising of four dimensions of growth i.e., high-road, and low-road growth; high-road, and lowroad decline to examine the performance of the Indonesian electronics industry during 2000-2014 and clarify whether economic and social upgrading or downgrading occurred.It finds that the industry has experienced economic and social downgrading, in other words, it is positioned in the dimension of low-road decline dimension. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Mapping the ecosystem of Hungarian AI-solution providers, collecting, and analysing data of their solutions, activities, and performance, we identify the main mechanisms of AI-driven upgrading. We argue that AI-solution providers induce productivity and resource efficiency improvement at technology adopters by enabling process upgrading. By selling their services to the local subsidiaries of global companies, they intensify the local backward linkages of these companies. Increased local embeddedness of subsidiaries is an important manifestation of economic upgrading. Additionally, AI-solution providers diversify the drivers of growth. In dependent market economies, where export-oriented manufacturing activities controlled by efficiency-seeking foreign investors used to be the main (unique) growth engine, the activities of domestic-owned AI solution providers represent a new driver of growth: technology-oriented entrepreneurship. We found, however, that the economic impact of Hungarian AI-oriented ventures is limited, no matter how innovative their solutions are. Managerial implications include the indispensability of devising an adequate business development strategy and a value capture strategy. Without adequate entrepreneurial skills, and without being visible on the global stage of 'AI-start-ups to watch', the development prospects of even the most innovative ventures are limited. A key policy implication for supporting the scaling up of AI start-ups by promoting the adoption of AI-powered solutions and stimulating venture capital financing promises good return on public investments. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

In agriculture, the integration of producers into food value chains has created new employment in farming and processing, although it may also lead to precarious jobs, forced labor, and riskier environments for farmers and workers. The “upgrading” concept put forward by value chain researchers claims to address these concerns as it describes how producers can improve their position within a value chain, and hence, their livelihoods. The paper critically evaluates the conceptual foundation of “upgrading” and its applicability in food value chain governance for the realization of SDGs related to responsible production and decent work. An overlooked element contributing to upgrading and the achievement of these SDGs is learning among value chain actors.

However, the lack of sophistication of institutions for industrial upgrade and the attainment of productive routines means that many local firms remain self-organized and suffer from the absence of complementarities. This study seeks to understand Malaysia's position on MIT and compare the country's current trajectory against newly industrialized economies (e.g., South Korea and Taiwan). This study focuses on five explorations that depict Malaysia's performance position in achieving developed status: (1) income and foreign direct investment, (2) economic structure, (3) upgrading, (4) social capital, and (5) education. This study argues that the key barriers that prevent Malaysia from exiting MIT stem from the lack of effective measures in terms of social capital to improve education and institutions. Thus, the development of productive routines with instituted inclusive measures to accelerate the upgrading process is crucial to break MIT. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Sensor-based ore sorting is being increasingly used to reduce the amount of low-grade and waste material processed in mineral concentrators. This type of preconcentration provides bottom-line bene..ts to users by reducing the amount of energy, water and consumables, as well as reducing capital cost. Existing operations can increase metal production, while previously uneconomic deposits and low-grade stockpiles can also be exploited. The technology can also be used to separate ore types for selective processing. The path to implementing sensor-based sorting may include: • geometallurgical evaluation • first inspection testing to investigate sensor response • bench-scale testing where sensor selection is not obvious or for difficult applications • performance testing in full-scale sensor-based sorting machines • larger scale site-based piloting with a temporary semi-mobile plant installation. Sorting requires material to be suitably prepared and presented to the machines, and typically this consists of crushing and screening to limit top size and optimise liberation. However, where material streams are suitably sized and prepared, additional equipment may not be required such as the sorting of semi-autogenous grinding (SAG) mill pebble streams. This paper presents a case study of economic upgrading of gold ore by preconcentrating with sensor-based ore sorting. The case study examines sorting amenability, test work and the feasibility study through to implementation, with associated flow sheet development. The development process is analysed and evaluated with a view to rationalising the process for development of future projects. In addition, limited financial modelling based on expected results is shown to illustrate the benefit to the operation. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Although aquaculture is the fastest growing food producing sector in the world and generates significant employment opportunities at multiple scales, men and women are not necessarily able to participate in aquaculture value chains in the same way, and benefits may not be evenly distributed between them. This paper aims to elucidate current knowledge of gendered engagement in and returns from aquaculture value chains. It does so by presenting a review of existing evidence on gender issues in aquaculture value chains along five key dimensions: gender division of labor, distribution of benefits, access and control over assets and resources, gender and social norms, power relations and governance. Subsequently, the potential results for value chain performance and potential upgrading pathways are presented. The review shows that there is limited high quality sex-disaggregated data regarding aquaculture value chains, in particular related to the distribution of benefits in the chain. It also shows that evidence is limited regarding other aspects of the quality of women's participation in and returns from these chains. Existing evidence, however, indicates gendered imbalances in all five dimensions assessed, with formal and informal barriers, including gender norms, limiting women's equal engagement and returns. The specifics were found to vary by context and to be shaped in relation to factors such as class, needs, and social and religious norms. The impact of gender inequity on value chain performance was also found to be an area of literature for which evidence is still limited. While the upgrading pathways as described in the literature may result in economic upgrading, they may have limited effect on improving inequity or social conditions in the chain, if they do not take underlying inequities in institutions into account. Together the evidence indicates the need for research to elucidate practical ways to increase women's engagement in and returns from aquaculture value chains through addressing formal and informal barriers to women's control over assets, including shifting underlying gender norms and relations towards gender equality. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Upgrading through global value chains (GVCs), or moving to higher value activities, has become important for economic development and job creation in the global economy, where competition remains intense and production has become fragmented and geographically dispersed (Cattaneo et al., 2013). Linking lead firms in GVCs with small and medium suppliers in diverse local contexts is a major business challenge in different types of industries, whether characterized by producer-driven chains like automobiles, electronics, or shipbuilding for whom finding and nurturing technically capable local suppliers is a requisite of global supply chain management for manufacturers who play a leading role in determining what and how to produce (Contreras et al., 2012; Sturgeon, 2003; Sturgeon et al., 2008), or in buyer-driven chains like apparel and footwear, where low cost is a major driver and retail buyers govern how the chains work (Bair and Gereffi 2001; Schmitz, 2004, 2006), or fresh produce and food products, where safety and quality standards are of utmost concern for supermarkets and their customers (Humphrey and Memedovic, 2006). In order to maintain good supplier relationships in all of these settings, GVC lead firms have developed more active strategies of corporate social responsibility (CSR) (van Tulder, 2009). While CSR is a multifaceted notion, it generally refers to ‘the responsibility of enterprises for their impacts on society’ (European Commission, 2011). It encompasses a wide range of efforts through which firms seek to integrate social, environmental, ethical, and human rights as well as consumer concerns into their core business practices. The goal is to maximize the benefit of shared value for a broad set of stakeholders, including owners, shareholders, and the wider society, while reducing potential negative impacts of corporate business practices to a minimum. There is a growing concern, however, that economic upgrading-countries and firms moving to higher value activities in GVCs with improved technology, knowledge, and skills (Gereffi, 2005: 161)-is no longer sufficient for sustainable CSR in global supply chains, given accumulating evidence and recent exposés about child labor, vulnerable workers, and abysmal working conditions in many export-oriented clusters located in developing countries (see Lund-Thomsen and Lindgreen, 2014; Lund-Thomsen and Nadvi, 2010a). Improving both economic and social conditions for workers and communities linked to GVCs is a vexing development problem, and it has attracted considerable attention by researchers, policy makers, and donor communities. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {A significant proportion of trade now takes place through coordinated value chains in which lead firms play a dominant role globally and locally. The outsourcing of production by Northern buyers has stimulated the growth of manufacturing, agriculture, and service industries in the South. It has promoted regional and global production networks (GPNs) that have opened up supply opportunities in new and expanding markets, including China, India, and Brazil. Firms engaged in GPNs have opportunities for economic upgrading through engaging in higher value production or repositioning themselves within value chains. However, they also face challenges meeting buyers’ commercial demands and quality standards, which smaller and less efficient producers find hard to satisfy. The expansion of global production in labor-intensive industries has been an important source of employment generation. Many of the new jobs have been filled by women and migrant workers who previously had difficulty accessing this type of wage employment, and they have provided new sources of income for poorer households (Raworth, 2004; Barrientos et al., 2003). Where such employment is regular and generates better rights and protection for workers, it can promote social upgrading and decent work. The demand for higher quality standards often requires skilling of at least some workers and provision of better employment conditions. But for many workers, this is not the outcome. Much GPN employment is insecure and unprotected, and ensuring decent work for more vulnerable workers poses significant problems. Indeed, a key challenge is how to improve the position of both firms and workers within GPNs. This is particularly important in developing countries, where firms and workers are increasingly integrated into regional or global production systems involving many locations. Accordingly, this chapter explores the obstacles and opportunities for promoting decent work through economic and social upgrading in the context of GPNs. It draws on previous empirical studies in which we examined each type of upgrading/downgrading separately. Based on these insights, it aims to advance a more integrated analytical framework linking economic and social upgrading/downgrading. Rossi’s (2011) case study of the Moroccan garment industry provides an early application of this framework, which can inform much-needed future research on the linkages between economic and social upgrading. This research indicates that firms’ economic upgrading can, but does not necessarily, lead to improvements for workers. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The possibility of realizing production systems which deliver high social, environmental, and economic performance has gained attention in internationalization studies at large. While the literature has focused on large firms from Western countries, we investigate the role of firms from emerging economies (EE) in supporting upgrading and improving the social and economic conditions of local producers while delivering a quality product targeting a sophisticated market niche. This chapter present evidence of an Indian firm specialized in the home and fashion industries (Industree), which successfully improved social and environmental conditions along its value chain through the social entrepreneurship approach. This case study shows that also EE firms can promote social and economic upgrading among their suppliers and that economic upgrading is necessary for the attainment of social upgrading. Design and retail, usually prerogatives of developed country firms, are key factors in supporting the achievement of success in both dimensions. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

It examines structural and environmental features of cases encoded in a data set derived from over 1000 audit reports compiled by the Fair Labor Association. Focusing on the apparel, sports- and footwear industry, the article highlights the importance of regulatory quality, economic performance and social freedom in sourcing countries for the success of private governance. The analysis statistically underlines the importance of public governance specifically for process rights, such as anti-discrimination and freedom of association. Complementarity between private and public governance programmes may therefore be particularly important for these standards. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This paper evaluates the outcomes from an ambitious wildflower harvesting programme in South Africa's Western Cape, which has sought to achieve positive outcomes in terms of socio-economic development and biodiversity conservation. Indigenous wildflowers, harvested according to conservation principles, are processed into ‘Cape Flora’ bouquets and sold into international and domestic markets. The principal supply chain provides an example of ethical trade due to the explicit environmental and social standards that are required at local sites of production. The incorporation of such standards represents an attempt to engender economic and social upgrading within the value chain. In this sense, the programme is consistent with dominant policy discourses, which suggest that exploiting potentially profitable niches within international trade flows represents a ‘high road’ to economic growth and transformation. The paper focuses upon the job creation and social impacts of the programme in the context of efforts to overcome South Africa's deeply entrenched socio-economic disparities and high poverty levels. Despite impressive growth in production and exports during the global financial crisis, there have been mixed outcomes in terms of benefits to stakeholders at the upstream end of the supply chain. The paper concludes by considering the extent to which local initiatives operating under the framework of ethical trade possess the potential to facilitate effective social and economic upgrading. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The TV format business has evolved rapidly since the formation of a global format trading system at the millennium, with one notable exception: the UK remains the world’s leading exporter. Considering the UK was once a net importer of (US) TV formats, it is a remarkable turn of fortune that poses two questions: what lies behind it and can the recipe be applied elsewhere? This article argues that British broadcasting regulation helped build a local TV production sector that excels at export, and that it contains the core elements of a global value chain (GVC)-oriented policy. Comparing UK initiatives with other nations and regions (the Middle East, Israel and South Africa) demonstrates the benefits of the British regulatory framework. Using the TV format trade as a case study, this article acknowledges that the world media system may be unequal but, contra to the cultural imperialism thesis and critical political economy theory, it argues that developing countries can take measures to scale their creative industries and, in particular, encourage local TV producers to participate more actively in the TV content GVC. Strategies for economic upgrading, this article concludes, must use IP laws to incentivize creativity, must not restrict international trade, and need to take into account the global nature of the TV content value chain to help local firms position themselves accordingly. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

After three decades of high-speed growth, the marginal areas of Guangdong Province — the lab of China's market-oriented reform and open door policy, are still fraught with desakotas, semi-urbanized areas of mixed landscape, economic and administrative systems. Chaonan faces a number of challenges, such as economic slowdown, poor infrastructure, environmental pollution, and so on. We found that China's desakota is driven by decades of rural industrialization, and this is now becoming a major challenge to master planning, the paradigm of which mainly comes from the rational theories of early western countries. As the traditional paradigm emphasizes the overall blueprint, there is a mismatch between planning orientation and spontaneous investment demand. Planning implementation thus is almost impossible. As such, we take the master plan of Chaonan as a case to integrate both blueprints and actions. To turn traditional blueprint-led planning into action-led planning, we highlight both recent and long-term actions, to make practical improvements to various facets, socio-economic upgrading, socio-spatial transformation, and environmental sustainability. Above all, we argue that action-led planning is the key to the transformation of desakotas in China. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The ICT-ITES (information and communication technology-information technology-enabled services) sector has been a major driver of economic growth and employment creation in India. Extensive research has been conducted in the past decade on access to this sector, employment terms and conditions and opportunities for upward labour mobility. Surprisingly, few studies have focused on the workers indirectly engaged in the ICT-ITES sector and whether and how they are able to benefit from growth of the sector. ICT-ITES firms primarily engage temporary and contractual workers through staffing agencies or labour contractors. In particular, low-end support services (viz. security, housekeeping and cab services) are availed of on a contractual basis through specialized service providers. Based on empirical data collected in Mumbai, and using the concepts of “servile class” or “service underclass” (see Scott, A world in emergence: Cities and regions in the 21st century, 2012; Standing, The precariat: The new dangerous class, 2011), this chapter examines how employment conditions and labour standards are changing in these support services through servicing the ICT-ITES sector. Whereas the ICT-ITES sector provides a major stimulus for growth and economic upgrading in these support services, its workers firmly remain a part of the (urban) working poor. Herewith, this chapter contributes to a better understanding of the labour flexibility regime in urban India and highlights the complexities and implications of contractual work for the low-skill, low-paid job service segments. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Purpose: This paper aims to examine the relationship between economic upgrading (implementing higher value-added activities) and social upgrading (improvements in workers’ rights and employment) of supplier firms in global value chains (GVCs) governed by multinational enterprises (MNEs). This paper answers Buckley and Ghauri’s (2004) and Buckley and Strange (2015) calls to incorporate other theoretical approaches within the international business (IB) literature. Furthermore, the paper also responds to Lee and Gereffi (2015) argument, published in Critical perspectives on international business, of the need to incorporate the social impact of upgrading in the IB literature. Design/methodology/approach: Semi-structured interviews were undertaken with representatives from five supplier firms each in Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, as well as with industry representatives. Findings: Governance patterns within GVCs can create the conditions for economic upgrading leading to social upgrading achievements. Institutional factors also affect the conditions for social upgrading. Although moving to higher value-added activities is critical for supplier firms, this does not necessarily lead to social upgrading. This paper’s research findings suggest that the combination of economic and social upgrading is positively associated with suppliers manufacturing high value-added products and operating in relational networks. In contrast, economic upgrading, by itself, was limited to those firms manufacturing low value-added products, typically those in captive networks. Originality value: This research is among an emerging body of literature seeking to integrate the GVC literature with the IB field. Importantly, it also contributes to the GVC literature by providing insight into an under-theorized aspect – the relationship between social and economic upgrading. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This paper examines economic upgrading in the Canarium indicum (Canarium) nut industry in Vanuatu, the Solomon Islands and Papua New Guinea. Canarium is a tree that is indigenous to Melanesia, and has been the subject of several commercialisation attempts since 1988. The paper assesses the outcomes to various actors in the Canarium supply chain from attempts to upgrade industry products and processes by: (1) increasing the available resource in suitable locations; (2) improving nut products and processing techniques; (3) increasing actors’ knowledge and supply chain coordination; and (4) establishing product standards. A two-phase data generation process was implemented. Document analysis and participant observations of industry workshops initiated a set of four economic upgrading interventions that were adaptively implemented. A second stage of workshops and 76 interviews enabled outcomes to be assessed at the project's end. Findings suggest that a small number of urban-based entrepreneurs benefit and subsequently are lead actors in industry development, but at the expense of benefits being distributed to a larger, more spatially disparate group of smallholder and small commercial growers. These economic upgrading outcomes are circumscribed by core-periphery relations in Pacific small island states and the scale of industry in each country. Thus, spatial inequalities are reproduced through the emerging Canarium industries. We argue that different routes to industry development are required in each country. Development initiatives that capitalise on the benefits of micro-enterprise clusters, joint action and regional institutional arrangements are proposed to overcome the impediments imposed by the particular geographies of Pacific island states. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Recent decades have witnessed an increasing integration of developing countries into global value chains (GVCs). This growing participation in global production sharing has raised hopes for economic upgrading within such value chains. However, globalization has intensified international competition, and achieving economic upgrading is not an easy task. Moreover, the social consequences of participating in GVCs are not always positive; however, they have received considerably less attention in the literature. This paper suggests a simple and parsimonious approach to measuring economic and social upgrading (and downgrading) in GVCs. Applying this parsimonious methodology and using quantitative secondary data, we analyze how widespread upgrading has been in four selected manufacturing GVCs: apparel, wood furniture, automotive, and mobile phones. We also investigate to what extent downgrading is part of the reality and undertake a comparative analysis across GVCs, regions and country groups (developing vs. developed countries). We find that the promise of industrial upgrading through participation in GVCs does not materialize for everyone. Indeed, economic upgrading has taken place in just over a quarter of the countries in our sample, among them mainly developing countries. Finally, we examine the relationship between economic performance and social performance in the different GVCs to investigate whether or not economic upgrading is typically associated with social upgrading. While patterns differ across GVCs, we find that economic upgrading is more likely to occur simultaneously with social upgrading than without, and vice versa. Our analysis, thus, suggests that economic upgrading is conducive to, but not sufficient for, social upgrading to occur. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Over the past several years, the creative reuse of brownfields has played a major role in Chinese cities to give their urban landscape a so-called second development. This paper analyses the governance of the brownfield restructuring in Guangzhou (Canton). The research is based on a study of the T.I.T Creative Industry Zone, a highly successful creative space currently in danger of demolition. This paper follows DiGaetano and Strom's (2003) analytical governance framework. This approach allows for deciphering the complexities of decision-making through a well-structured set of interdependent categories. In Guangzhou, new policies and institutions have been promoting the restructuring and have contributed to the formalisation of public-private interactions. In general, this indicates a shift towards a more corporatist governance. However, the study of T.I.T reveals a rather intricate picture: the policymaking remains influenced by a top-down authoritative style - sometimes in an arbitrary manner - and to some extent also by particularistic exchanges. This indicates a complex mode of urban governance consisting of increasingly corporatist elements but still with managerial, and to a lesser extent, clientelistic elements. Finally, the coexistence of different governance modes seems to be a typical outcome of China's transition while still remaining more adaptive, experimental and flexible in nature. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

In this paper, we investigate the initiation and growth process of the cloud computing industry in China, based on an in-depth case study. We discover that the development of China's cloud computing industry that emerged from an initial concept involves the co-evolution of technological and institutional infrastructure leading to a preliminary cloud ecosystem. We also find that such a process involves a wide range of different actors, from the government side to the business side, the interaction among which, in pursuing their own interests, drive the development of the cloud computing industry into being. Finally, situated in the institutional context of China, the government-business relationship is witnessed to have changed and evolved along development of such an emerging industry, demonstrating the important and unique roles of both sides in industrial (or even national) wide diffusion of the ICT innovation. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

This article shows that even under a quasi-hierarchical governance structure, suppliers in Bangladesh have made significant progress in economic upgrading, particularly process and product upgrading. Competitive pressure linked to the ‘open sourcing’ of apparels has caused leading firms to ease conditionalities on the production process. Preferential access to major markets, timely responses to buyers’ changing demands, favourable policies related to the import of raw materials, production and export of apparels and new labour-related policies have facilitated economic upgrading. Suppliers have accordingly benefited from substantial investment in productive capacity, technological know-how and workers’ skills. Further upgrading would require more investment in firm-level productivity and improvement in physical and social compliance. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

The chapter reviews Turkey's participation in three key industries: the automotive sector, the textiles and apparel sector, and the agri-food sector. The results show that Turkey is relatively present in GVCs. However, the country seems to specialize in assembly and low value added segments of the value chain. It is also important to evaluate the spillovers from foreign direct investment (FDI) to the domestic economy. The results show that high R&D expenditure and/or a high technological intensity are beneficial for Turkey's manufacturing firms. In addition, supplying fully foreign-owned companies significantly helps boost the productivity of domestic firms. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Peter Evans’ theory provides conceptual clarity about state and society relations in the developmental state model. The developmental state in Taiwan has found other ways to facilitate development in the era of globalization. As a postindustrial economy, Taiwan has shifted its industrial focus away from manufacturing toward the knowledge-intensive innovation economy.

New research in the past decade allows us to better understand how CSR is linked to industrial clusters and GVCs. With geographic production and trade patterns in many industries becoming concentrated in the global South, lead firms in GVCs have been under growing pressure to link economic and social upgrading in more integrated forms of CSR. This is leading to a confluence of “private governance” (corporate codes of conduct and monitoring), “social governance” (civil society pressure on business from labor organizations and non-governmental organizations), and “public governance” (government policies to support gains by labor groups and environmental activists). This new form of “synergistic governance” is illustrated with evidence from recent studies of GVCs and industrial clusters, as well as advances in theorizing about new patterns of governance in GVCs and clusters. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

The paper focuses especially on the upgrading efforts of the fish farming firms operating at the industry's upstream node. Based on research and qualitative personal interviews with firms involved in the Singaporean aquaculture industry, this paper argues that the city-state's wider institutional context - dirigisme in governing the utilization of land and sea space, and commitment to a liberalized trade regime to feed its populace - complicates the upgrading efforts of the fish farming firms. Notwithstanding the inherent complexities of economic upgrading per se, such findings prove that while upgrading is an effort driven by the firm and its cohort of stakeholders, the effort is unlikely to succeed if the broader institutional and regulatory environment that the firms are embedded in is not conducive. © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

It aims to illuminate how GVCs can advance our understanding about MNEs and rising power (RP) firms and their impact on economic and social upgrading in fragmented and dispersed global production systems. Design/methodology/approach – The paper reviews theGVCliterature focusing on two conceptual elements of the GVC approach, governance and upgrading, and highlights three key recent developments in GVCs: concentration, regionalization and synergistic governance. Findings – The paper underscores the complicated role of GVCs in shaping economic and social upgrading for emerging economies, RP firms and developing country firms in general. Rising geographic and organizational concentration in GVCs leads to the uneven distribution of upgrading opportunities in favor of RP firms, and yet economic upgrading may be elusive even for the most established suppliers because of power asymmetry with global buyers. Shifting end markets and the regionalization of value chains can benefit RP firms by presenting alternative markets for upgrading. Yet, without further upgrading, such benefits may be achieved at the expense of social downgrading. Finally, the ineffectiveness of private standards to achieve social upgrading has led to calls for synergistic governance through the cooperation of private, public and social actors, both global and local. Originality/value – The paper illuminates how the GVC approach and its key concepts can contribute to the critical international business and RP firms literature by examining the latest dynamics in GVCs and their impacts on economic and social development in developing countries. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Purpose – The purpose of this paper includes two interconnected objectives. The first is to provide a reconceptualisation of social value creation as social constraint alleviation. The second is to respond to the call put forward by Giuliani and Macchi (2014) to produce synergies between bodies of literature exploring the development impact of businesses. The paper focuses on ideas from the global value chain/global production networks (GVC/GPN), business and human rights, corporate social responsibility (CSR), international business (IB) and (social) entrepreneurship literatures. Design/methodology/approach – The paper offers a reconceptualisation of social value creation by building on the synergies, complementarities and limitations of existing concepts identified through the literature review. Findings – The reconceptualisation of social value creation put forward in this paper contributes to the literature in the following way. It offers a useful and clear definition of the term “social” (Devinney, 2009), and it attends to the limitations of the constraint concept as put forward by Ted London and his collaborators (London, 2011). Furthermore, it sketches out the basic ideas of a two-system approach to allow for the differentiation between symptom treatment and root cause alleviation. Finally, it offers a refinement of Wettstein’s (2012) proposed capability-based remedial action concept. The paper furthermore proposes that there are three distinct ways in which businesses generally respond to social constraints. Originality/value – The paper illustrates how the redefined concept of social value creation can connect different bodies of literature and help make sense of existing empirical results, without engaging in definitional debates. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

The aim of this paper is to analyze the process of building a framework to develop creative spaces in the southern mega-city Guangzhou and to provide further insights into the complex aspects of the local state. To this end, it presents an in-depth study of Guangzhou's Redtory Art + Design Factory. Redtory witnessed a unique development path: while it was initially merely tolerated as a creative space, it soon developed into one of the most prominent creative zones in southern China; presently, however, it is threatened with demolition. This analysis employs the concept of the "entrepreneurial state" developed by Jane Zheng. The results of the analysis suggest that a high degree of personalized coordination of key resources still prevails at the local level. This is nonetheless happening in spite of the gradual evolution of a regulatory framework governing creative spaces at the municipal level. This indicates that the institutionalization of creative spaces is in no way complete, but rather fragmented. Ultimately, this case-study indicates that the entrepreneurial local state and its policy-making are highly dependent on higher levels of the party-state. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The influence of expanding hotel companies on economic development in host countries is one of the most under-researched aspects of the globalisation of the hotel industry. Aiming to contribute to this agenda this paper focuses on the expansion of international hotel groups into Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) after 1989 and enquires into their influence on economic upgrading in CEE following the fall of communism. The paper is grounded in the global production network (GPN) perspective and selected assumptions of evolutionary economic geography (EEG), a combination of which is argued here to be an effective theoretical platform from which the targeted set of processes can be addressed. The paper proposes a framework for analysing the influence of the hotel industry on regional development in host economies. Four areas of influence are distinguished: direct investment and infrastructure upgrading; employment creation; knowledge transfer; and forging local linkages. The first three of them are then analysed in more detail on the basis of Poland, Estonia and Bulgaria. It is demonstrated that the influence of hotel groups on regional development hinges upon the business model preferred by the group for a given hotel and, depending on various place-specific factors, it may have different manifestations in different markets. The paper also shows that it is often other actors from hotel groups’ GPNs, rather than hotel groups themselves, that play a key role in creating and enhancing the value which the region captures and in influencing the path of development which the region follows. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Slum tourism is an expanding domain of research focused on organized tours to poorer areas of cities in the global South, such as South Africa's urban townships. The aim is to contribute towards a reframing of scholarship on slum tourism by directing attention to the phenomenon of tourism development occurring in rural slums or poverty areas of South Africa, namely the former rural Bantustan or Homeland areas. These rural areas are presently the focus of government attention for tourism promotion as part of economic upgrading and employment creation. The key findings are that the expanding tourism economy of these rural slumlands is dominated by domestic tourists rather than international visitors with most tourists engaged in VFR travel including trips to rural second homes. In addition, these areas are important foci for religious pilgrimage. In terms of international scholarship on slum tourism the paper offers the significant observation that the largest share of tourists originate in the country's urban township areas which are the attractions for international slum tourists. The destinations for visits by international slum tourists are therefore the essential source regions of tourists for visits to the rural poverty areas or slumlands of South Africa. This points to an imperative for broadening the research agenda of slum tourism to incorporate research which examines the tourism mobilities of ordinary residents of townships or favelas. © 2014 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

This has taken place by the development and redevelopment of defined core areas, such as the Zhujiang New Town as Guangzhou’s new CBD, Guangzhou University Town, or Guangzhou Science City as flagship project for establishing knowledge-intensive high-tech industries. At the same time and despite an otherwise strongly government-led and top-down followed urban planning system, one can observe very dynamic economic upgrading processes in areas not in the city or district governments’ focus. Here, planning power seems to be overridden and replaced by micro-stakeholder organizations such as urbanized villagers or private investors. Taking a case study from Guangzhou, the chapter investigates how areas of economic change are developed differently, looking at aspects of actor involvement, their objectives, and relations in these processes showing that indicators for a maturing megacity can also be found there. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The promotion of creativity is a crucial element in China's attempts to upgrade its economic structure. In this context, creative spaces, located in derelict industrial sites, have become prominent symbols of China's so-called Second Transition (Bottelier, 2007). The basic hypothesis of this paper claims that the development of these sites not only implies a restructuring of inner city brownfields, but also new modes of urban governance. Altogether eight creative spaces in China will be compared over time. The empirical research is based on qualitative interviews and an extensive evaluation of policy documents. This paper argues that the governance of creative spaces can be described as a path from informal experiments at the local micro-level to the development of a comprehensive toolset of mainstream policies at the municipal level. This happened in face of the shifting acknowledgment of creative industries from the national level. Consequently, Beijing and Shanghai became spearheads regarding the legalization of creative spaces. This paper further shows that within the institutional milieu of creative spaces, the local state acts as a very pragmatic key decision maker. In conclusion, the local state plays several decisive roles in the course of the development of creative spaces: a transformer of land use rights, a regulator in developing a legislative framework, a mediator between former operator and real estate developer, an investor and distributor of public funds, a supervisor and manager of the local economic development and last but not least a supervisor of creative spaces. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

This article analyses how the social relations of workers are affected by economic upgrading in the wild berry global commodity chain (GCC). It is argued that the social effects in a GCC are the result of multiple power spatialities, which must be analysed both according to workers' rights and from a household perspective. In the Swedish wild berry GCC, foreign workers are contracted on a seasonal basis to collect the raw material. The regulated workers, who are principally from Thailand, are subject to social upgrading as well as social downgrading, involving the potential for both exploitation in the Swedish labour market and social empowerment in their homeland. It is concluded that a complex mix of hierarchical, networked and topological power spatialities explain the construction of the wild berry GCC and its effects on worker relations. © The University of Hertfordshire Business School and W.

	abstract = {How can developing countries upgrade their industries to compete in the world? Scholars of development and international business have increasingly argued that the attendant ability of local firms to upgrade - combine existing resources in new ways to create new higher value products - depends in large part on their access to a variety of knowledge resources (Moran and Ghoshal 1999; Song 2002; Giuliani, Pietrobelli, and Rabellotti 2005). However, it is less clear what types of institutional infrastructure facilitate such access. A growing current in the innovation literature argues that access to knowledge depends often on whether firms are embedded in rich interfirm networks, which enable them to build collaborative relationships, gain resources, learn, and coordinate experiments (Powell, Koput, and Smith-Doerr, 1996; McEvily and Marcus 2005). However, scholars also note how the stickiness of past firm practices, social structures, and institutions are slow to change and can constrain one's access to new knowledge resources (Uzzi 1996). This enabling and constraining nature of embeddedness resonates strongly in emerging market countries (Spicer, McDermott, and Kogut 2000), and especially Latin America, where societies are often noted for their weak institutions and social capital (Levitsky and Murillo 2005). © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

The well-documented mechanisms for this cross-national flow of knowledge all involve interfirm connections, such as trade, foreign direct investment (FDI), and alliances. We examine the potential of a different mechanism - interpersonal ties abroad - that has only recently become practicable, owing to advances in communication and transportation technologies, globalization, and increased migration. We investigate when business knowledge obtained from interpersonal ties in more-developed countries is more useful than locally sourced knowledge. Using a sample of South African managers, we find that knowledge from more-developed countries is not always more useful. Rather, overseas knowledge is preferable when novel and accessible: that is, when new-to-the-industry knowledge is needed, when there is already a strong tie, and when the knowledge does not involve a long discussion. Conversely, local knowledge is preferable when new-to-the-industry knowledge is not needed, when the interpersonal tie is a weak tie, and when a longer discussion is warranted. This study demonstrates the value of connections between individuals in countries at different levels of development as sources of useful knowledge, and suggests that international business research will benefit from exploring further the networks of individuals in addition to those of firms. © 2013 Academy of International Business All rights reserved. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Weak university-industry linkages (UILs) contribute to this problem, though there were sporadic success cases in some key industrial sectors representing high-tech, mid-tech and resource-based industries. The state of Thai UILs is a reflection of weak downstream demand by indigenous Thai firms, limited commercial focus and capacity within the university system and bureaucratic fragmentation. These problems in turn reflect the country's broader political economy, including Thai development strategy, weak labour as well as business emphasis for upgrading, political fragmentation and the relatively low level of pressures (foreign exchange, external threats and popular protests) on Thai leaders to promote institutions that favour innovation. © 2013 SAGE Publications. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Empirical evidence suggests that firms develop green strategies to reduce environmental impacts while achieving economic benefits and competitiveness, which may be internal to the firm but also apply to value chains, with different implications in terms of bargaining power and value appropriation. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment. © 2013 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This paper interlinks new spatial planning strategies, such as urban and intra-urban rescaling and strategic planning, against the background of political economic upgrading programs as in the case of Guangzhou mega-city. Global and domestic competition force China's metropolises to constantly reorient themselves and adapt their urban development strategies. In the Pearl River Delta, the restructuring process from basic manufacturing to modern service and high-tech industries with higher added-value has already been going on for some time. The main hypothesis of this paper is that this upgrading of industrial structures and urban policies aimed at enhancing economic competitiveness in general are both important drivers for administrative rescaling on the municipal and intra-urban levels, for the implementation of increasingly strategic urban planning approaches and for organizational innovations. In mega-cities such as Guangzhou, this development coincides with a rising significance of urban districts in the urban planning hierarchy. We show how this happens by analyzing urban policies regarding the reform of administrative powers granted to Guangzhou Development District (GDD). In the course of this change, the GDD administration was upgraded from the status of a state manager of a development zone to that of a district governing authority in 2005. It is now responsible for comprehensive urban management. This paper is based on extensive literature review and field observation as well as expert and stakeholder interviews. © 2013 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

This study questions this linearity and extends demand theory through a case analysis of the film industry in two developing countries. When unsophisticated local demand results in well-matched supply- and demand-side elements, benefits do accrue. Low exposure to technically superior products in Nigeria allowed a fully fledged film value chain to develop, as consumers were willing to support lower quality output. Although the industry is too weak to seriously threaten incumbents from the developed world on the global stage, it has substantial impact in its home country. In contrast, if demand is far more sophisticated than supply, local industry will struggle to respond to broad-based demand signals and will achieve accelerated learning only in niche areas. South Africa has become a niche producer in the global film industry rather than film producer in its own right partly because the widespread demand for Hollywood-quality products could not be met by local supply capabilities. © 2009 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {In this paper, the relationship is traced between art and gentrification in the neighbourhood of Yorkville, Toronto, from 1960 to 2007. Following the exodus of artists and the more experimental art galleries in the 1960s, a result of social and economic upgrading, Yorkville was forced to recast its identity, a process that involved reproducing the creative pulse of the 1960s art scene. A set of interviews conducted with visual artists who worked and/or lived in Yorkville during the 1960s is centrally located in the piece to provide a context for the shift from production to consumption. In the remainder of the paper, the role of artistic production in the gentrified landscape is examined through three examples: theming through design, art galleries and sculpture. It is argued that the relationship between art and gentrification must be extended to include the role of the non-visible in the (re)production of place identity. © 2008 Urban Studies Journal Limited. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Through a comparative, longitudinal analysis of the wine industry in two Argentine provinces, this chapter examines how different political approaches to reform shapes the ability of societies to build new institutions for economic upgrading. Upgrading in wine and grapes often demands the creation of skills and the coordination of experiments in processes, products, and functions across a wide variety of organizational forms and sub-regions. Inherited structural factors per se can not easily explain the different solutions to this challenge. In particular, although voluntary associationalism improves the needed social learning and collaboration, it is also self-limiting. A better explanation focuses on how governments confront the dual challenge of redefining the boundary between the public and private domains, and of recombining the socio-economic ties among relevant firms and their respective business associations. A 'depoliticization' approach emphasizes the imposition of arm's-length incentives by a powerful, insulated government, but appears to contribute little to institutional change and upgrading. A 'participatory restructuring' approach promotes the creation of public-private institutions via adherence to two key principles: inclusion of a wide variety of relevant stakeholder groups, and rules of deliberative governance that promote collective problem-solving. The latter approach appears to have the advantage of facilitating collaboration and knowledge creation among previously antagonistic groups, including government. © 2014 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

The cation-exchange capacity of zeolite for zinc, copper and silver was respectively 2.26, 1.86 and 2.44 meq g <sup>-1</sup>. The exchange was incomplete, but equilibrium was rapidly attained. Cyanide adsorption isotherms, constructed at three different temperatures, showed that the zeolite was very selective for cyanide. The solubility products of the cyanide precipitate and the exchange capacity of zeolite for individual cations governed the adsorption capacity of the zeolite. The method also remains selective in the presence of some other anions. Kinetic data for cyanide desorption in water and sodium chloride solution indicated that zeolite retains most of the adsorbed cyanide. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

This technology uses pneumatic isostatic forging (PIF) to provide a unique capability to produce high quality Aluminum alloy products with enhanced mechanical properties that are uniform throughout the part, thus permitting higher design allowables and increased usage of Aluminum alloy castings. The fundamental mechanism underlying PIF is a single mode plastic deformation process that uses isostatic application of pressures for 10 to 30 seconds at temperature. The process can be integrated in-line with other production operations, i.e., using the latent heat from the previous casting step. The results of applying the PIF process indicate lower cost and significant improvement in mechanical properties that rival and often exceed corresponding properties of other technologies like hot isostatic pressing (HIP) and related processes. This process offers many advantages that will be described in the paper in addition to presenting case histories of property enhancement by PIF, and the mechanism responsible for property enhancement. © 2004 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam.

	abstract = {South Africa's negotiated settlement and its transition to democracy reads like a modern fairy tale. A brief review of South Africa's social indicators serves to temper some of optimism about the country's future. The indicators reflect the society's quality of life which has been shaped by its turbulent history. Political "caste formation", changing political alliances, the reforms intended to forestall the demise of apartheid, and the race for global competitiveness have left indelible marks on the society's social indicators. A comparison of living conditions in South Africa with those of roughly comparable economies indicates that the country lags behind in securing overall and widespread socio-economic upgrading of the population at large. A review of a cross-section of South African indicators and their trends over time shows that South Africa is still a very deeply divided society with a very large backlog in socio-economic development. There is evidence of breakdown in the society's social cohesion. Popular expectations of future quality of life indicate that the euphoria following on the first democratic elections has been replaced by a sense of realism among all sectors of the population. It is concluded that quality of life as reflected in South Africa's social indicators may get worse before it improves. The challenge will be to avoid new forms of economic "apartheid" which would depress the quality of life of marginal sectors of the population at the expense of the economically privileged. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {In general, a proactive strategy entails an anticipatory approach to problems. It is also associated with taking the initiative and doing more than is strictly needed. The nature of proactivity that businesses may display with respect to the environment is considered and also its meaning in terms of strategic behaviour and technological development. A conceptual framework is developed that differentiates between types of proactive strategies. This framework is based on a study of the paint and coatings industry in Great Britain and the Netherlands and is applicable to both countries. Even though the big international paint companies play a decisive role in the development and introduction of cleaner technologies, it is argued that the small‐ and medium‐sized paint companies deserve special attention. Not only is proactive behaviour by the big companies important, but also proactive strategies by the small‐ and medium‐sized companies, even if they are limited in scope, because the latter determine at national and local levels the pace and nature of the transformation that has to take place to produce a sustainable economy. This process is crucial to ecological modernization if it is intended not only to get rid of old‐fashioned ways, but also to create new opportunities for economic upgrading and rejuvenation.

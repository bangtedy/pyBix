	abstract = {The expansion of global seafood value chains in recent decades has benefited developing countries, which are key producers and exporters. However, developing countries still need to upgrade themselves in many relevant areas to meet requirements such as product and labor standards proposed by global buyers. Upgrading is recognized as a pathway for developing countries to capture more benefits or maintain their position within those chains. Determining which types of upgrades are suitable for each country is challenging. This research uses the gravity model to examine the impacts of value chain upgrading on seafood exports from developing countries. The key findings suggest that product upgrading positively affects traded seafood, while the impacts of process and functional upgrading on the seafood exports of the selected countries can be positive and negative. In addition, social improvements are more important for seafood exports to developed countries. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

The findings are as follows: First, digital technology innovation significantly promotes the digital transformation of the manufacturing industry. Second, value chain upgrading plays a crucial mediating role. Digital technology innovation reshapes the value-added distribution across research and development design, production and manufacturing, and marketing service links, thereby generating industrial chain synergy effects. Further heterogeneous analysis indicates that the marginal effect of digital technology innovation on digital transformation is significantly higher for state-owned enterprises compared to private enterprises. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The imposition of reciprocal tariffs by the United States has significantly impacted Vietnam’s agricultural export sector, challenging its trade stability and policy responsiveness. This study aims to review and assess Vietnam’s existing agricultural export policies in light of these external shocks, while proposing improvements to enhance competitiveness and resilience. By employing content analysis as the primary research methodology, the paper systematically examines relevant laws, government decisions, trade agreements, and policy reports issued by key institutions. The research is framed within three theoretical perspectives: trade policy theory, global value chain (GVC) theory, and institutional theory. These frameworks are used to explore the external policy tools available, Vietnam’s position in international supply chains, and the institutional capacity to adapt to changing trade environments. Findings indicate that Vietnam’s current policy framework remains fragmented and reactive, with limited coordination among ministries, underdeveloped value-added strategies, and weak institutional mechanisms for export promotion and enforcement. The study emphasizes the importance of integration of agricultural policy strategically with trade diplomacy, institutional reform, and value chain upgrading. Ultimately, the paper suggests that a more comprehensive and proactive policy approach―grounded in international economic theory and supported by effective governance―will be essential to safeguard and strengthen Vietnam’s agricultural exports in the evolving global trade landscape. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Against the backdrop of the profound adjustment of the global value chain, how technological spillovers from imported intermediate goods affect the heterogeneous innovation paths of firms is a core issue for developing countries. Based on the panel data covering 278 prefecture-level cities in China, this paper constructs micro-trade and spatial Durbin models to empirically examine the differential impacts of technological spillovers from imported intermediate goods on high- and low-technology innovation and their spatial effects. This study finds that (1) technological spillovers from imported intermediate goods significantly increase the high-technology innovation level of local firms, generating a 'technological dividend'. However, they have no significant effect on low-technology innovation, potentially triggering a 'low-end lock-in' effect. (2) Technological spillovers reduce innovation costs by enhancing regional absorptive capacity, where the import of semifinished products directly drives high-technology breakthroughs through product innovation, while the import of components indirectly optimizes innovation efficiency through process innovation. (3) The spatial spillover effect of high-technology innovation is significant, forming innovation clusters centred on the Yangtze and Pearl River Deltas, while the regional collaborative effect of low-technology innovation is relatively weak. This research provides a theoretical basis for developing countries to balance import expansion and independent innovation. It suggests strengthening regional absorptive capacity and innovation ecosystem construction to avoid the risk of low-end lock-in and to achieve global value chain upgrading. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

On this basis, it empirically tests the Global Value Chain (GVC) upgrading effect caused by the degree of centrality, connection strength, and heterogeneity of the trade network of renewable energy products. Results demonstrate that the degree of centrality, connection strength, and heterogeneity of the trade network of renewable energy products have significant value chain upgrading effects, and their effects vary due to different trade directions and industrial development stages. In the entire stage of industrial development, the effect of network degree centrality on the promotion of the value chain division of labour is gradually weakened, and the effects of connection strength and geographical concentration on the promotion of the value chain division of labour are inverted N-shaped and N-shaped, respectively. Further analysis shows that there is a significant threshold effect based on the level of economic development between the connection strength and heterogeneity of the trade network of renewable energy products and the value chain division status. The conclusions of this study provide a new perspective for a country to realize the high-end climbing of the renewable energy product value chain in combination with its own national conditions. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Value chains have often been a part of the discourse on promoting local development, including in the context of agrarian societies. Lately, the idea of value networks, which is extended from the concept of value chain, is also gaining importance due to its ability to help navigate through the interconnectedness of various entities involved in the process of value co-creation, exchange, and capture. We see an opportunity to apply the value network perspective in furthering the discourse on local development, especially in remote rural contexts where the communities depend on agriculture and allied activities. In this study, we consider the case of the emerging kiwi production sector in the Eastern Himalayan Region of India and analyze it by combining the traditional value chain and the value network perspectives. Our study is mainly based on primary data collected using different tools and techniques from various stakeholders of the kiwifruit sector in the study region. We first conduct a value chain mapping and analysis to discuss the value chain upgrading opportunities. Subsequently, we critically appraise how value (economic and non-economic) is co-created and captured in the identified value network. When juxtaposed with the linear value chain perspective, the value network perspective provided us with greater clarity on the role played by a larger set of actors and their interconnectedness in co-creating value. These actors interact in ways that lead to the development of dynamic capabilities and competencies in the network, promoting resilience and characterizing the development of the local economic system based on local interventions. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

This study uses panel data on trade and carbon emissions between China and 21 Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) economies from 1991 to 2021, applying a fixed-effects model to analyze changes in embodied carbon emissions. The focus is on China, the largest developing country, as it participates in the APEC regional value chain (RVC) in different ways. It is confirmed that China is leveraging RVCs to achieve industrial transformation from the perspective of value added. Subsequently, indicators for forward and backward participation in RVCs are constructed, recalculating their impacts on carbon emissions in terms of scale, structure, and technology. The results indicate that China's forward participation exhibits a "U-shaped"relationship with trade-related embodied carbon emissions, while backward participation demonstrates a negative correlation. Industrial heterogeneity analysis further highlights distinct impacts across high-tech, low-tech, pollution-intensive, and nonpollution-intensive sectors. Furthermore, scale effects, structural effects, and technological effects represent distinct pathways influencing trade-related carbon emissions. These findings can assist developing countries in advancing sustainable development and achieving carbon peak goals. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This study examines how systematically managed innovation routines drive value chain upgrading and competitive performance among Korean manufacturing SMEs. Drawing on the dynamic capabilities view and routines-based perspective, a conceptual model was developed to analyze the relationships among three innovation routines (technological innovation systematization, product development, and manufacturing), two dimensions of upgrading (product and process), and overall competitiveness. Survey data from 131 SMEs reveal that technological innovation systematization routines strongly enhance both product development and manufacturing routines. Product development routines, in turn, significantly boost both product upgrading and process upgrading, whereas manufacturing routines significantly affect only process upgrading. Further, both types of upgrading are shown to improve a firm’s competitive advantage, with process upgrading emerging as particularly impactful in cost-sensitive, subcontracting contexts. These findings highlight the importance of cross-functional integration, open innovation, and balancing product-focused and process-focused strategies. By clarifying how resource-limited SMEs can systematically build and leverage innovation routines, this research offers novel theoretical insights and practical guidelines for firms seeking to ascend global value chains under competitive pressures. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

However, the growing use of robots in emerging economies may help mitigate these negative effects. This study, drawing on a theoretical model and empirical analysis, reveals that the adoption of robots in China, a developing country, significantly enhanced firms' positions in global value chains (GVCs). A detailed analysis reveals that markups and the structure of intermediate inputs were key mechanisms. The study also found that improvements in human capital enhanced the efficiency of robots, enabling firms to use them more effectively, which further strengthened the firms' position in GVCs. The positive impact of the adoption of robots on GVC upgrading was more pronounced in non-resource-based cities and cities with high labor costs. Furthermore, the study highlights that robot adoption in medium- and high-tech industries had a greater impact on GVC upgrading. In conclusion, this study suggests that robot adoption in emerging economies can enhance their position in GVCs, with human capital playing a crucial role. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Since the 1980s, state capacity has been a major explanation for countries leaving the middle-income trap. However, this literature is unable to explain the failed experiences of countries with relatively high state capacity. This was the case of Chile after the unsuccessful enaction of a series of policies in the mid-2010s to upgrade the country’s position in the lithium value chain. To understand this failure, we combine the literature on developmental states and the literature on business power. We use the concept of institutional business power to understand how business actions erode state capacities leading to countries’ persistent inability to leave the middle-income trap. In the case of Chile, despite the relatively high levels of state capacity, previous processes of deregulation and privatization in the country configured a situation favorable to business’ monopolization of information and technical knowledge about lithium production and innovation processes that directly affected the capacity of the state to regulate the sector, let alone implement policies designed to upgrade the industry. The article highlights the need to investigate further the role of not just the state, but of the private sector in either facilitating or blocking value chain upgrading in countries caught in the middle-income trap. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The construction of green factories not only represents a novel, voluntarily adopted environmental regulatory practice but also serves as a critical step for enterprises in their transformation, upgrading, and pursuit of sustainable development. Using the green factory establishment policy issued by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) as a quasinatural experiment, this study investigates the impact of voluntary environmental regulation on corporate environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance. Results demonstrate that green factory enterprises achieve significantly higher ESG performance than nongreen factory enterprises in the short and long term. Mechanism analysis identifies key pathways: government subsidies and innovation-driven upgrades through digital and green technologies, with subsidies further triggering a chained mediation effect. Heterogeneity analysis reveals stronger ESG improvements in state-owned enterprises, heavy polluters, large enterprises, and enterprises with sustained innovation capabilities (firm-level), as well as in economically advanced, high levels of Confucian culture, and well-governed regions (regional-level). The moderation analysis demonstrates that investor attention and corporate reputation positively moderate this relationship. Notably, in enterprises with high investor attention, the moderating effect of corporate reputation is particularly pronounced. The economic consequence analysis suggests that improvements in ESG ratings generate multiple positive outcomes for enterprises, including increased long-term R&D expenditures, enhanced total factor productivity, and value chain upgrading. These findings provide a comprehensive perspective on how environmental regulation can foster corporate sustainable development. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Social capital plays a crucial role in collective action, yet its impact on farmers’ access to resources, trust-based networks, and market coordination remains underexplored. This study examines how social capital shapes resource access and marketing strategies in farmer organizations, focusing on seven cases from the rice value chains in Côte d’Ivoire and Ghana. Using network analysis and Quadratic Assignment Procedure (QAP) correlation, the research identifies different patterns of service access based on trust and proximity. The findings reveal that resource access in farmer groups depends on the structure of their networks—whether centralized or decentralized—alongside external support and policy conditions. In Ghana, social ties have a weaker influence on resource access compared to Côte d’Ivoire. Moreover, organizations with decentralized networks tend to work more with wholesalers, while those with centralized networks sell directly to consumers. These insights contribute to the broader discussion on how farmer networks influence market participation and value chain upgrading in developing countries. Policy recommendations emphasize the need for agricultural development programs to consider leadership dynamics, trust, and organizational governance structures when designing interventions for farmer organizations, cooperatives, and Water Users Associations. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

This paper suggests that, apart from the technical demands of the problem at-hand, it is also necessary to observe how governments at the subnational level practice path-dependent "sticky"styles of industrial policy that consistently favor some policy tools and approaches over others. Drawing upon four industry cases in the Mexican states of Jalisco (electronics, and information and communication technologies) and Querétaro (automotive and aerospace), we identify two distinct local industrial policy styles, as the former state deployed a Business-guided style while the latter relied upon a State-guided alternative. These styles, in turn, were each biased towards some forms of upgrading over others, leading to two main conclusions: first, that local policy styles must be taken into account to understand how deviations from technocratic policy selection appear. And second, that these styles can generate long-term impacts on the kinds of industrial upgrading observed. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Employing a staggered difference-in-difference approach on a large sample of Chinese firms, we find that UHV transmission projects positively contribute to value chain upgrading and green transformation of manufacturing firms. Robustness tests confirm this relationship and further mechanism exploration reveals that UHV transmission projects significantly improve capacity utilization rate, industry development and technological innovation. We also confirm that the effects are more pronounced for state-owned enterprises, firms with higher profit growth or more cash flows as well as manufacturing firms on both ends of input and out regions or highly-energy dependent enterprises.

	abstract = {Background: The production of liquid biofuel in Eastern Africa countries has the potential to play an important role on the global biofuel markets in the coming years, because transportation fuel demand is expected to grow. Despite the presence of suitable environmental conditions for bioenergy crop cultivation in Eastern Africa, liquid biofuel production has been restricted by different factors, including market situation and government policies. The objective of this review is to evaluate the potential markets, policies, strategies, and plans for liquid biofuel production in some Eastern Africa countries, including Ethiopia, Kenya, Sudan, Tanzania and Uganda. Main text: Over 64 scientific articles and reports published between 2002 and 2023 related to liquid biofuel production market and policies were collected from internet search engines and unpublished grey literatures and reviewed. Since liquid biofuel production was in early stage of investment in Eastern Africa countries by 2020, all the countries showed similar restrictions. It was found that the global market demand for liquid biofuel increased after 1980s. For example, although Ethiopia started bioethanol production in 1950s, the production was discouraged by the lack of a market. Biofuel trade is globally determined by the biofuel policies of industrialized countries, which are mainly driven by the willingness to reduce emissions and to tackle volatile fossil fuel prices. Eastern Africa liquid biofuels has a number of market openings, including rural domestic use, substituting fossil fuel imports, and supplying the European market. There are also attractive legal conditions and political willingness to invest in the production of liquid biofuels. However, institutional weaknesses hindered the possibility to coordinate liquid biofuel production. The lack of adequate domestic institutions, coordination mechanisms, and robust monitoring resulted in land-use conflicts, corruption, and technical challenges. Appropriate policy measures are required to local land use determination, selection of appropriate type of bioenergy crops, and biofuel processing types and scales. In particular, small and large-scale biofuel production projects are required to include biofuel production in the conventional agricultural farming practices. Conclusions: Good governance is highly important for bioenergy crop production, liquid biofuel processing and consumption in the whole liquid biofuel value chain. Moreover, it is important to exchange good practices through cooperation, including—but not limited to—intra-African countries, which would accelerate the learning process and the deployment of effective measures and mechanisms. There should be biofuel value chain upgrading to overcome fragmentation and inconsistency of measures; match-making between demand and supply at domestic, intra-African, and internationally with proper public awareness creation. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

This paper uses China, a quintessential representative of such economies, as a case to explore how technology transfer can facilitate the upgrading of enterprises' GVCs. This research aims to reshape the international strategic positioning of Chinese enterprises by promoting the integration and development of technology transfer and the GVC. Utilizing patent data from Chinese manufacturing enterprises, as well as data from Chinese industrial enterprises and customs records from 2004 to 2014, this study empirically examines the relationship between technology transfer and the upgrading of enterprises' GVCs. Additionally, the moderating effect of industrial agglomeration is incorporated into the research framework.The findings reveal that both technology transfer in and technology transfer out significantly positively influence the upgrading of enterprises' GVCs, highlighting the crucial role of technological knowledge flow in enhancing enterprise positioning within the GVC. Furthermore, industrial agglomeration is shown to exert a positive moderating effect on GVC upgrading as a result of technology transfer out. This study provides valuable insights for policymakers, enterprise managers, and academics, enabling a more nuanced understanding of the pivotal role of technology transfer in reshaping GVCs. Consequently, it offers robust support for the internationalization strategies of Chinese enterprises. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

This study also empirically validates the conceptual framework and proposes hypotheses using structural equation modeling, with 355 Chinese manufacturing firms as the research sample. Empirical findings demonstrate that all the three types of risk and the two main characteristics of blockchain (i.e., blockchain traceability and security) positively contribute to the supply chain risk–blockchain technology fit. Results also suggest that the supply chain risk–blockchain technology fit positively affects new product development (NPD) performance.

	abstract = {The Global Value Chain (GVC) has become a mainstream analytical framework to map the unequal distribution of value-addition and surplus-capturing power across the global supply-chain economy. Gender and development scholars find that gender inequality in and beyond the GVC constitutes unequal distribution of economic surplus in the GVC. Meanwhile, the GVC discussion also generates a normative development prescription for Global South actors, upgrading their positions in the GVC through strategic accumulation of technology, innovation, and human capital. While gender has been integral to the scholarly analysis of the GVC distributional problem, it is largely absent from scholars' evaluations of the GVC solution of value-chain upgrading. Especially considering that one key element in value-chain upgrading strategies-human capital accumulation-inevitably relies on social institutions that are highly gendered, it is worth questioning the presumption that the costs and gains of value-chain upgrading agenda are "gender neutral." I question this presumption through a case study of China's recent transition to a value-chain upgrading regime and its impact on female internal migrant workers, who have constituted the backbone of China's manufacturing economy. Since the late 2000s, the Chinese state has embraced a new, GVC-informed, developmental regime that has focused on upgrading the "quality" of its manufacturing economy through industrial policies (some part of which was once known as "Made in China 2025") and enhancing the "quality" of its future workforce through labor, welfare, and population law reforms. While the Chinese state's upgrading refortn formalized certain factory jobs and expanded social benefits to migrant workers, the reform's heavy emphasis on human capital investment-lacking sufficient public support though it did-dramatically intensified the demand for unpaid parenting work from female workers, which drove them to more precarious and lower quality home-based industrial work in their inland hometowns. This resulted in new gender-based subordination dynamics in the supply chain and unequal access to the gains of "upgrading." This case study contributes to the gender and value chain literature by highlighting the genderedyet often invisible labor costs of human capital investment that are integral to value-chain upgrading and the role of welfare and labor law and development policies in creating and distributing such costs. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {With the digital transformation of the global economy and the deepening of the concept of sustainable development, China's construction machinery industry faces major opportunities and challenges in the reconstruction and upgrading of the global value chain. Based on the dynamic capability theory and the collaborative innovation theory, this study constructs a theoretical framework of "digital transformation-green innovation-global value chain upgrading" to explore the impact of the synergy between digital transformation and green innovation on improving the position of Chinese construction machinery companies in the global value chain. This study uses a multi-source data fusion method, combined with patent data, financial statements and questionnaires, to construct an unbalanced panel data set of 189 listed construction machinery companies in China from 2010 to 2022, and uses econometric methods such as dynamic panel modeling, threshold regression and machine learning to analyze. The study finds that: (1) The impact of digital transformation on the global value chain upgrading of construction machinery companies presents a nonlinear "U-shaped" curve relationship; (2) Green innovation plays a positive regulatory role in the relationship between digital transformation and value chain upgrading; (3) There is a significant synergy between digital transformation and green innovation; (4) The quality of the institutional environment has an important impact on the synergy, and a high-quality institutional environment enhances the synergy; (5) Enterprise heterogeneity significantly moderates the impact of synergy on value chain upgrading. The study expands the theory of global value chains, enriches the theory of collaborative innovation, provides a new theoretical perspective for the integration of digital economy and green development, and provides practical guidance for enterprises and governments to formulate relevant strategies and policies. Future research can further explore the cross-national comparison and long-term dynamic evolution of synergy effects. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Due to the exacerbation of climate change, agricultural water security has risen to a prominent position on the global agenda. However, virtual water trade isn't always beneficial for enhancing water resource sustainability; instead, it often leads to serious trade distortion problems due to unreasonable industrial and trade structures. This study employs pathway decomposition method to highlight the path characteristics of such distortions, revealing how virtual water trade distortions occur, why there are regional differences, and what insights can be gained for policy formulation. The study focuses on the agricultural sectors of seven key provinces in China. Findings indicate that virtual water in these provinces' agricultural sectors is predominantly exported through inter-regional and inter-sectoral intermediate goods trade. Furthermore, in regions where virtual water trade distortion is more severe, this characteristic becomes more apparent, leading to significant exports of virtual water. However, the trade chains for importing virtual water are usually short and direct, resulting in a relatively low volume of virtual water imports. These characteristics are closely related to the value chain participation mode. The policy implication is: while “value chain upgrading” has become a trendy term, merely improving trade conditions without enhancing the processing of agricultural products for export, or simply increasing imports of low-end intermediate inputs without upgrading the agricultural input structure for imports, offers no assistance in alleviating virtual water trade distortions. Based on these findings, we propose several differentiated strategies to mitigate virtual water trade distortions. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Through a set of difference-in-differences estimations at the county level, we find a variety of heterogeneous effects of SEZs on new firm births with respect to characteristics and geographical locations of zones and industry type of firms. Specifically, national-level zones significantly increase the birth of new service firms (value chain upgrading effect), while the introduction of provincial-level zones has a significant positive impact on the start-up activities in the manufacturing sector (industrialization promotion effect). Furthermore, the analysis confirms that the increased local market size and reduced travel and innovation costs explain the value chain upgrading effect of national-level zones in urban areas. And the decline in land prices emerges as a potential mechanism for the industrialization promotion effect of provincial-level zones in peripheral counties. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

The smart city pilot policy, which aims at reshaping the urban development model in China, is carried out and regarded conducive to achieving high-quality development. Nevertheless, regarding whether and how smart cities could promote GVC upgrading, research is scant. We adopted the approach of time-varying difference-in-differences (DID) and used a dataset that encompassed 174 prefecture-level cities between 2005 and 2017 to investigate the impact of China’s smart city pilot policy on the GVC upgrading of cities. The findings indicate that, firstly, GVC upgrading is significantly enhanced by building smart cities in China. Secondly, this favorable influence on GVC upgrading is mainly through channels of informatization, innovation, and industrial structure adjustment. Thirdly, the influence is more pronounced in eastern cities and cities with better conditions in terms of human capital, fiscal capacity, and information infrastructure. This research provides evidence and policy implications for China to move forward with the smart city establishment in a bid to upgrade GVCs and achieve high-quality growth. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Manufacturing servitization has become an important trend in the development of global manufacturing. Under the policy goal of global value chain upgrading, it is of great significance to discuss how manufacturing servitization affects the participation and position in global value chains (GVCs). Based on the OECD Input-Output Tables (OECD-ICIO) from 2008 to 2018, we calculate the level of manufacturing servitization in major economies. At the same time, based on the TIVA database, two indicators reflecting the upgrading of the global value chain are calculated from the dimensions of “participation” and “division position”. This paper empirically examines the mechanism and effect of manufacturing servitization on the upgrading of GVCs. Our findings reveal the following: (1) Manufacturing servitization has a significant enhancement effect on global value chain upgrading. (2) Manufacturing servitization can affect the upgrading of GVC through “cost reduction effect, technology spillover effect and specialization effect”. (3) Manufacturing servitization in developing countries has a greater promoting effect on the upgrading of GVC(4) For manufacturing industries with different levels of technological development, the promotion effect of manufacturing servitization on high-tech industries is more obvious. This paper has two main implications: On one hand, the government should not only increase support for the service sectors, but also promote the innovative development of the service sectors. On the other hand, it is necessary to improve the level of opening up to the outside world, make full use of the positive “spillover effect” of high-quality service elements, and promote the integration of production-oriented services and manufacturing. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Countries integrate into backward, value-importing linkages with the aim of accumulating technological capabilities and transitioning towards creating their own forward, value-exporting chains and capturing a greater share of the value generated within GVCs. Existing knowledge, which is largely fragmented and descriptive, points to a number of uncertainties and complexities that make this process anything but linear. It is open question whether the deepening backward linkages facilitates forward integration in GVCs. Using data from 65 countries over two decades, we show that the impact of backward integration on forward integration in GVCs varies over time and that it is moderated by the level of development of the country, the diversity of the GVC partner network and the innovation conditions in the home market. The research adds a new perspective to the literature on GVC-driven upgrading. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Design/methodology/approach: The study uses a quantitative research method. The data are collected using an online questionnaire administered to respondents working in Chinese automobile manufacturers in China and Laos. The data are analyzed using structural equation modeling (SEM) and related software. Findings: The results show that DCs and innovation capabilities (ICs) positively affect GVC upgrading and that ICs plays a mediating role between DC and GVC upgrading. Dynamic capabilities evolution (CE) mediates the relationship between DCs, ICs and GVC upgrading. Finally, differences exist in the effects of the three dimensions of DCs on ICs and GVC upgrading. Practical implications: Focusing on the absorption and transformation of knowledge, enterprises could experience a clear enhancement of IC and CE and be more likely to obtain higher marginal returns. The study provides insights for emerging market firms to gain higher added value in internationalization. Originality/value: This study demonstrates that different dimensions of DCs have different effects on GVC upgrading. In terms of theory, the impact of IC is considered in terms of the mediating effect of CE on IC. Differences are highlighted concerning the impact of learning capability, integrating and coordinating capability and sensing capability on the mediated relationships. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

The conclusions still hold after addressing the potential endogeneity and robustness concerns. Mechanism test results show that the effects of productivity enhancement and institutional quality improvement are important channels for RTAs-deepening to promote value chain reshaping. Heterogeneity test results indicate that ‘WTO-X’ provisions of RTAs are more conducive to promoting value chain reshaping, and the promoting effect of RTAs-deepening on value chain reshaping is more significant for the manufacturing industry.

	abstract = {Accelerating the upgrading of traditional energy industries has become a key area of concern for global green and sustainable development. Notably, few existing studies have focused on the spatial-temporal variability of energy industry advancedization and its resource-environment decoupling effect. This paper was the first to measure China's energy industry advancedization index based on the perspective of industry chain elements and value chain structure, analyzed the spatial-temporal evolution and elemental characteristics, and explored the resource-environment decoupling effect and nonlinear impact. The results showed that energy industry advancedization in China displayed a slow-growth trend from 2008 to 2020, and the spatial unevenness of energy industry capital and workforce advancedization gradually deepened. The decoupling effect of resource endowment dependence in the evolution of energy industry advancedization was better than that of environmental pollution, the spatial decoupling process was better in the eastern and central regions than in the western and northeastern regions, and the decoupling pressure of resources and environment in some regions was still significant. The trend of the nonlinear effect of energy industry advancedization on resource endowment dependence and environmental pollution showed an inverted “N” and “N” shape, respectively, and the nonlinear effect had obvious stage characteristics and regional heterogeneity. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {[Objective] Cultivating innovation capability is conducive to the break through of resource dilemmas and the realization of global value chain (GVC) upgrading by manufacturing enterprises in underdeveloped areas. Therefore, it is of great significance to explore the impact of innovation capability on GVC upgrading and its mechanism from the perspective of resource orchestration. [Methods] Taking 219 questionnaire data from Yunnan automobile manufacturing enterprises, structural equation modeling was applied. Based on the resource orchestration theory, this study explored how manufacturing enterprises in underdeveloped areas can enhance their innovation capability through effective resource management and thus capture more value-added in the GVC. Dynamic capability evolution mechanism was introduced to explore the process of resource orchestration acting on innovation capability. [Results] (1) Resource orchestration facilitated enterprises to achieve GVC upgrading by enhancing innovation capabilities. (2) On the basis of effective resource management, enterprises influenced innovation capability by improving the evolution of dynamic capability, that is, the breadth, depth, and speed of dynamic capability combination, which in turn positively affected the GVC upgrading. (3) The three types of resource orchestration had heterogeneous effects on capability and upgrading. Resource utilization had the most pronounced effect on GVC upgrading by facilitating dynamic capabilities evolution. However, resource integration had the most pronounced effect on GVC upgrading through the enhancement of innovation capability. [Conclusion] In the process of enhancing innovation capability, enterprises in underdeveloped areas should pay more attention to the integration of upstream and downstream resources and the development of internal and external resources, so as to provide continuous impetus for realizing value-added in the context of resource constraints. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Under the background of China’s economic development model gradually changing from external demand to domestic demand, this paper examines the impact of the “demand-side” local market consumption upgrade on the rise of global value chains in strategic emerging industries, which is of great significance in promoting the realization of domestic and foreign double circulation and seizing the high ground in the field of science and technology. This paper comprehensively uses the WIOD world input-output table from 2000 to 2014, as well as the data of China’s provincial economic development, the data of Listed Companies in strategic emerging industries, the import and export data of China Customs and China’s patent data from 2003 to 2016, to systematically investigate the internal mechanism and effect of local market consumption upgrading on the rise of the global value chain of strategic emerging industries from the industrial and enterprise levels. The study found that: The upgrading of consumption in the local market has a significant role in promoting the upgrading of the global value chain of China’s strategic emerging industries, and this role is mainly achieved by enhancing the scale of the local market and the ability of independent innovation of enterprises; After considering the crowding-out effect of house prices, the establishment of subsidiaries and endogeneity of listed companies, this conclusion still holds. Further research shows that in strategic emerging industries, the global value chain upgrading effect of consumption upgrading in the local market shows obvious heterogeneity of industry, region and enterprise ownership types. Moreover, consumption upgrading in foreign markets still plays an important role in promoting the global value chain upgrading of strategic emerging industries, but consumption upgrading in domestic markets has become a more important driving force for cultivating the global value chain upgrading of strategic emerging industries. The research in this paper shows that further improving the consumption quality of domestic demand is of great significance to promote the formation of a new development pattern of domestic and international double circulation and realize the upgrading of global value chains in strategic emerging industries. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {In the context of the deepening division of labour in global value chains (GVC) and the goal of “double carbon”, it is important to promote China’s manufacturing industry to break away from the unfavourable situation of “big but not strong” so as to achieve low-carbon transformation and value chain upgrading. Based on the panel data of China’s manufacturing industry from 2006 to 2018, this paper adopts a threshold regression model to analyse the marginal impact of GVC embedding position on carbon productivity. It also comprehensively explores the moderating effects of R&D investment, environmental regulation, industrial structure upgrading, and industrial digitisation on the impact of GVC embedding on carbon productivity in three aspects: forward GVC participation, backward GVC participation, and GVC embedding position. The research shows that forward and backward GVC participation have negative direct effects on carbon productivity in China’s manufacturing sector, but the results of the heterogeneity analysis show that both forward and backward GVC participation are positively associated with carbon productivity in low- and medium-technology manufacturing industries. Improving the GVC embedding position will promote the improvement of carbon productivity, and the promotion effect will be increased and then decreased. Both R&D investment and industrial structure upgrading have strengthened the impact of GVC embedding. Environmental regulation weakens the inhibitory effect of backward GVC participation on carbon productivity, while industry digitisation has a negative moderating effect. Further heterogeneity analysis found that forward simple GVC participation was positively related to carbon productivity. The findings of this paper provide a theoretical and practical foundation for analysing the impact mechanism of GVC embeddedness on carbon productivity in China’s manufacturing industries. It is conducive to promoting China’s manufacturing industries to realise low-carbon transformation and climb up to the high end of the GVC, and it provides certain policy insights for the realization of the goals of “carbon peaking” and “carbon neutrality”. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Forest farmers’ organizations (FFOs) have recently gained scholarly attention as a collective action instrument to upgrade value chains. However, insights into possible business models and organizational forms of FFOs remain fragmented. This study thus aimed to co-create FFO business models in order to assess the business models in the context of the regulatory framework and the value chain upgrading theory. The Input–Output scheme and the Business Model Canvas (BMC) were merged to create an analytical lens. Participatory workshops with two farmers’ organizations, each in Ethiopia and Tanzania, were conducted and triangulated with ten focus group discussions and 25 key informant interviews. The co-created business models reflected the grassroots entrepreneurial potential of smallholders to envision FFOs. The gaps requiring external support, namely the know-how in accessing microfinance, silvicultural practices, and entrepreneurship, were revealed. We argue that the transformation from a farmers’ organization to an FFO enables wood value chain upgrading. Diversifying wood with non-wood products is key for FFOs. Regardless of how the regulatory framework shapes external support, the local government plays a pivotal role in facilitating the connection between FFOs and (non-)governmental support actors. Through this research, we develop suggestions for further empirical studies and offer several recommendations for decision-makers. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Since launching its reforms and opening up, China has actively integrated itself into global value chains (GVCs) and experienced continuous growth. However, there exists a significant imbalance between GVC upgrading and economic growth across regions in China. Can GVC upgrading promote economic growth at the regional level? Despite the theoretical foundations and empirical evidence provided at the national level, research on GVC upgrading at the subnational level remains limited. This study constructs a temporal indicator to measure GVC upgrading at the finest subnational level, including cities at the prefecture level and above, and employs panel fixed effects (FE) and mediation models to examine the impact and mechanism of GVC upgrading on regional economic growth, aiming for a meaningful exploration in this area. The results show that GVC upgrading has a significant positive effect on regional economic growth with robust performance. Specifically, a 1-standard-deviation improvement in GVC upgrading leads to a 0.054-standard-deviation increase in the logarithm of per capita gross domestic product (GDP). Heterogeneity analysis shows that the promotion effect is more pronounced in coastal areas and administrative centers. Mechanism analysis indicates that GVC upgrading promotes regional economic growth by facilitating capital accumulation, promoting technological progress, and enhancing human resources, among which, facilitating capital accumulation plays the most significant role, accounting for over 70% of the economic growth effects associated with GVC upgrading. Thus, China should create an enabling environment for promoting GVC upgrading, enhance capital accumulation, foster regional innovation systems, improve the quality of human capital, and promote domestic market integration. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

It is found that: digitalization significantly promotes the improvement of green innovation level in manufacturing enterprises; digitalization promotes green innovation more prominently in labor-intensive industries and manufacturing enterprises in central China than in capital- or technology-intensive industries and enterprises in eastern China; and digitalization can influence green innovation in manufacturing enterprises through three intermediary channels: promoting enterprise value chain upgrading, empowering industrial structure optimization, and enhancing technological innovation. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Smallholder farmers from developing countries are among the most vulnerable populations facing high food insecurity. Participation in agri-food value chains can offer a valuable pathway out of poverty for millions of poor households in these regions due to their trans-sectorial ability to create empowerment, inclusion, and economic value. Current urbanization rates and the advent of a growing middle class in developing countries make local value chains linked to regional and domestic markets increasingly valuable for smallholder farmers. Under this context, governments and institutions are key actors in influencing pro-poor value chains upgrading trajectories, and public procurement is a way by which these actors can direct participants. This study addresses an important knowledge gap in the possible practical approaches to designing and implementing such schemes. Informed by a literature review, a contextual appraisal of the major advantages and disadvantages of public procurement for the pro-poor development of value chains was conducted. A framework of analysis and intervention is then proposed and discussed. Based on the critical and contextualized analysis of the evidence, we address strategies for public food procurement, challenges, mitigation measures, supporting interventions, and considerations for planning. Overall, our analysis suggests that several existing initiatives still lack tangible results, partly due to gaps in the implementation of laws and regulations. We also highlight that, if implemented as a stand-alone intervention, it is likely that public procurement will not be effective. Additionally, we make an argument on the importance of engaging with the private sector in the process of devising an exit strategy as part that supports long-term sustainability. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Food insecurity and child malnutrition remain persistent problems in sub-Saharan Africa. Rice is a staple food for more than half of the world’s population. However, white rice is poor in micronutrients and records higher glycemic values compared to parboiled rice. An improved parboiling system called “Grain quality enhancer, Energy-efficient and durable Material” (GEM in short) allows the processing of quality rice with better physical and nutritional properties compared to traditional systems. This paper assessed the drivers and impact of the adoption of the GEM system on women’s livelihoods. A total of 822 rice women parboilers were randomly sampled and interviewed in Benin, in regions where the GEM system was introduced. We employed the endogenous switching regression model (ESR) to assess the impact of the GEM system. We found evidence that adoption of the GEM system increased women parboilers’ rice output rate (dehulling return), income and food security and reduced poverty. The impact of the GEM system is estimated at 14.38 kg of milled rice per 100 kg of paddy (21.46%), equivalent to US$ 7.25 of additional income (17.77%). A significantly lower poverty rate of 26% was found among households due to the adoption of the GEM system. These results are supported by women’s perceptions that the output rate, better nutritional value and reduction of broken rice during dehulling are major advantages of the improved parboiling system. Policy actions such as training of local fabricators and credit options are required for out-scaling and sustainability of the improved parboiling system. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The privatization of state-trading enterprises (STEs) is posited as enabling dynamic upgrading. Malaysia has trialled this approach through Padiberas Nasional Berhad (BERNAS) as the lead firm in charge of development in the rice industry. Using published information, this study makes a longitudinal analysis at the structure, conduct, and performance post privatization through the global value chain theory. It shows that the entity has developed from a rice importation monopoly into a virtual monopoly/monopsony in rice value chain stages. In that patronage system, privatization and concentrated market structure have limited upgrading opportunities to their associated partners. Concurrently, it has morphed to a private company. The efficacy of allowing the pillar of national food security to be controlled by a private monopoly needs close examination. Only through that can governments ensure that broader social and development objectives are met, while minimizing the risks associated with both excessive reliance on a particular firm and the abandonment of competition. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {In the context of the policy objective of achieving industrial value chain upgrading and the reality that service outsourcing has become an important trend in global manufacturing development, it is important to explore how service outsourcing contributes to achieving value chain status upgrading in China's manufacturing industry. Based on the latest edition of OECD Inter-Country Input-Output tables (ICIO) from 1995 to 2018, this paper systematically examines the impact effects and mechanisms of offshore and onshore service outsourcing on the upgrading of a country's manufacturing value chain status. Further, we select a Chinese sample for comparative analysis. We find that: (1) Service outsourcing facilitates a country, s manufacturing industry to move downstream in the relative links in the industrial chain. Offshore service outsourcing plays a more important role in promoting the upgrading of the embedded position in the global value chain. (2) Mechanistic analysis reveals that outsourcing of services drives the downstream movement of a country's value chain links through three channels: Replacing imports of intermediate goods, reducing the number of cross-border purchases of intermediate goods, and increasing productivity, especially labor productivity. Also, service outsourcing significantly enhances the extent to which onshore outsourcing of services influences the embeddedness of value chains through headquarters economies and absorptive capacity. (3) Heterogeneity analysis shows that the impact of services outsourcing on changes in manufacturing embeddedness weakens over time and at lower income levels. Besides, the impact has differential effects across technology sectors and service types. (4) Further analysis using the Chinese sample shows that the results are generally consistent with the cross-country sample. The development of offshoring and onshoring in China's manufacturing industry also reduced the upstream degree of the manufacturing industry and thus promoting the upgrading of the embedded position in the global value chain. Moreover, the upgrading effect of offshoring is greater than that of onshoring. This study provides theoretical and empirical references for China to promote the upgrading of manufacturing value chains through the vigorous development of the service outsourcing industry under the development of new trade patterns and new models. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

This article adopts the complex network method to analyse the evolution of international RE competition patterns from the perspective of the industry chain, and evaluates the impact of RE competition on GVC status using a panel regression model. The results show that competition at different stages is becoming increasingly fierce, among which the downstream competition is the most intense, with more than 140 competitors. China and Germany have remarkable competitiveness in downstream products. In addition, RE competition landscape drives GVC upgrading by increasing the number of competitors and the tightness of competition, and the downstream has the greatest impact. An increase of 1 in tightness of competition of upstream, midstream and downstream products upgrade the GVC by approximately 0.359, 0.211, 2.744 units, respectively. Further, the impact on GVC upgrading of the competition landscape in high economic countries is more significant than that in countries with a low economic level. This study suggests that countries can upgrade their GVC by improving technology and establishing stable international relations with important trading partners. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

This article argues that green industrialization – specifically, manufacturing and the development of renewable energy technologies — creates economic gains that impact political processes and increase renewable energy policy ambition. Building on a combined framework of policy feedback and global value chain literature, we see domestic value creation as a key determinant of coalition strength and learning effects for policymakers. We analyze the relationship of value chain involvement to policy ambition using panel data on countries’ manufacturing and innovation activities in the wind and solar industry from 2010 to 2018. The results show a positive technology policy feedback mechanism, implying that higher local value creation leads to more ambitious renewable energy policies. These first large-N findings support previous case studies on the importance of green growth for raising policy ambition; it implies that transformative policies fostering value creation could create a virtuous cycle for policy ambition. We further propose an interdisciplinary research agenda to shed light on the role of value chain dynamics for policy feedback mechanisms across different political economies. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Based on city-level data, micro-level data for Chinese industrial enterprises, and data for listed Chinese enterprises, this study examines the impacts of urban housing prices on value chain upgrading. We find that soaring housing prices in China since 2004 stunted industrial value chain upgrading, as indicated by the value-added rate. When housing prices increase by 100%, the enterprise value-added rate decreases by 12.4%. Intermediary mechanism analysis shows that housing price increases lead to innovation input suppression effects and resource misallocation effects, which in turn obstruct industrial value chain upgrading. Further analysis demonstrates that the impacts of housing price increases on industrial value chain upgrading, presenting an inverted-U shape, are varied in terms of time and region. Enterprises’ value chain upgrading also showcases different degrees of sensitivity to housing price increases, due to their respective features. The conclusions of this study carry significant policy implications for the sound development of the real estate market and industrial upgrading in China, as well as in developing countries at large. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {According to FAO figures, over 129 million hectares of forests have been lost globally since the 1990s, mainly in the tropical Global South, where agriculture acts as the main driver of forest conversion. International commitments, such as the Bonn Challenge, aim to reverse this trend through the application of forest landscape restoration (FLR) as an integrated and inclusive restoration approach. Beyond the discourse level, however, FLR implementation lags behind expectations due to insufficient funding and a disconnection with local implementation. We argue that, instead of relying on public resources for conservation-driven restoration, increased private sector engagement may point the way out of the funding impasse. However, this requires a shift towards production-driven FLR, which includes the livelihood needs of communities and smallholders as agents of landscape transition. For achieving the dual purpose of connecting landscapes with markets and promoting sustainable landscape restoration, we ascribe value chains and their economic, social and ecological configurations a key role in production-driven FLR. Drawing on Vietnam’s forest restoration pathway as an illustrative case, we examine how production-driven forest restoration, smallholder engagement and value chain upgrading can stimulate positive landscape transitions. We conclude that, depending on their configuration, value chains can have negative or positive social and ecological impacts at the landscape level. Furthermore, regulated, progressive and high-value commodity chains may perform better in the areas of integrated FLR objectives landscape integrity, ecological functionality and human well-being. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {In the following paper, I examine the considerable impact of the recent world-economic shift that has determined the circumstances of Hungarian suppliers' value-chain integration. I argue that as a result of the specialized positions they occupied in the value-chain after the collapse of the Comecon market, Hungarian enterprises in export-oriented industries faced a dilemma - a trade-off between obtaining the most advanced technologies (and thus access to world-market niches) and retaining ownership in the hands of domestic capital. When company managers opted to protect ownership with the help of the state, they exposed themselves to greater risk of downgrading their position in the value chain. If they managed to get access to advanced technologies (and the requisite funding), they were more likely to lose control over their company's assets, either as a result of a hostile takeover or becoming part of the larger partner's merger-and-acquisition plans. This paper is a discussion of some of the particular characteristics of this dilemma, as well as a comparison with the experience of Hungarian service providers who implemented a different strategy. This paper is also a critical assessment of some of the chief characteristics of the world-economic evolution that has been underway since 2009, such as German automotive value chains' expansion in the CEE region and the growing role of Chinese capital in regional infrastructural projects. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

The Mauritanian rice market is mainly shaped by colonial heritage and is segmented into (i) elite White Hassanis, (ii) lower caste Black Hassanis, (iii) immigrants with colonial heritage, and (iv) a smaller group of immigrants with cultural heritage. While colonial heritage generally tends to incline consumers towards imported rice, local rice is preferred by Black Hassanis, older and more educated consumers, housewives, and wealthier families.

	abstract = {China's role in global value chains (GVCs) has changed fundamentally in recent decades. The country has moved from being the world factory for a diverse range of low-tech, mid-tech, and high-tech consumer goods to the goal of becoming a technological leader in sectors linked to advanced manufacturing, cloud computing, artificial intelligence, electric vehicles, and new e-commerce and internet-related production networks while lessening its dependence on the United States and other traditional export markets by focusing on its domestic market and emerging regional markets. China has achieved this transformation in its development trajectory by combining two drivers of change: upgrading from above and upgrading from below. While upgrading from above refers to the relatively familiar set of programs introduced by China's government that chart strategic shifts and new goals for the economy as a whole, upgrading from below is equally important but less well understood. It refers to the diverse set of local policies and firm-level activities at the provincial, regional, and city government levels that are required to implement and institutionalize China's national programs and policy directives. The chapters of this book illustrate how upgrading from below works in practice in China and they suggest new research insights on how to analyze GVCs in China and other developing economies. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {With the deepening of economic globalization, global value chain has become the key to promote the economic development of all countries in the world. Since the 18th CPC National Congress, China has continued to deepen its opening-up and comprehensively build an open economy. Economies around the world are closely linked by participating in the division of labor in the global value chain. In response to economic globalization and regional integration, 15 countries formally signed the RCEP in 2020. The establishment of the RCEP will help improve the investment environment, ease trade barriers and enhance trade production. In view of this, this paper constructs the global value chain division status index and participation degree index of RCEP member countries from the perspective of added value of trade, and uses the panel data of RCEP member countries from 2005 to 2019 to make an empirical study on the factors influencing the value chain upgrading of RCEP member countries. The results show that:(1) knowledge-intensive labor, innovative development, infrastructure and other factors can enhance the division of labor in GVCS; (2) Low-end production with participation level, excessive capital and degree of opening to the outside world will hinder the improvement of GVC of member countries; (3) The innovation capacity, infrastructure and other factors of developed member countries have a more significant impact on the status of division of labor, that is, the higher the degree of participation, the more the status of division of labor will be improved. Therefore, in order to enhance the division of labor among RCEP members, they need to strengthen their technological innovation capacity, attract high-end manufacturing investment, improve infrastructure construction and strengthen industrial linkages within the RCEP region. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {While services are an essential element in the global production, trade and consumption of manufactured goods, limited research has been conducted on the role of services in studies of global value chains (GVCs). Recently, however, an emerging literature on the ‘servicification’ of manufacturing in GVCs has evolved, most of which involves aggregate-level analyses of countries and sectors based on trade statistics. Previous studies have thus failed to explore whether and how local firms in developing countries may capture value and upgrade through their insertion into GVCs as service suppliers. In this paper, we contribute to the literature by analysing the development of an industry supplying wind-turbine services in South Africa. We draw on in-depth fieldwork, including fifty-two interviews and five case studies of firms operating as suppliers of various types of ‘embedded’ services to wind-power projects constructed in South Africa. We show the significant economic value in terms of the employment thereby created and the upgrading pathways of five local service-suppliers in knowledge-intensive and high value-added service activities. Our findings point to the benefit of devoting attention to the role of services in relation to upgrading in GVCs. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Empirical results at country-specific level show that OFDI exerts a positive effect on the home country's GVC upgrading via boosting technological advancement and raising trading network status, and the impact of OFDI in emerging countries is more significant than that in developed countries; meanwhile, the empirical test using China's sub-industry data indicates that compared with low and middle-tech (LMT) industries, OFDI of high-tech (HT) industries have a stronger impact on China's GVC upgrading.

Human capital expansion has the largest positive effect on state-owned firms relative to foreign and domestic private firms.

	abstract = {In this article, we analyze the strategies, surprises, and sidesteps in the World Bank’s 2020 World Development Report, Trading for Development in the Age of Global Value Chains. Strategically, the Report promotes an expansion of neoliberal globalization couched in the language of global value chains. Curiously detached from the broader academic literature on global value chains in international trade, it promotes a sequentialist vision of global value chain upgrading that evokes the stagism of classic modernization theory. The authors sidestep important issues, such as China's pivotal role in the landscape of global trade, and are largely silent on others, including climate change. Significantly and somewhat surprisingly, given the general endorsement of global value chain integration, the Report acknowledges negative distributional trends associated with the rise of global value chains, including the excessive benefits reaped by “superstar firms” and the now well-documented decline in labor's income share. These observations are not reflected in the document's policy section, however, where the World Development Report largely recapitulates familiar prescriptions, with the threat of nationalist populism and rising protectionism providing a new bottle for this old wine. Drawing on a range of literature including United Nations Conference on Trade and Development's 2018 Trade and Development Report, we highlight not only the limits of the Bank's adherence to an increasingly embattled orthodoxy, but also the necessary starting points for a more useful discussion of the merits, limits, and future of global value chains. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Driven by increased demand from both local and export markets and facilitated by far-reaching liberalization and privatization policies, the dairy sub-sector in Uganda has undergone significant changes in the last decade. With a comparative advantage in milk production, the southwest of Uganda has started to attract considerable Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in processing capacity, mainly targeting the export market. As a result, processing capacity increased five-fold and dairy became Uganda's third most important export product, coming from negligible amounts a decade earlier. In this study, we use data collected at different nodes within the value chain to identify some of the key innovations in these value chains. This is done by comparing the area that received the bulk of FDI to a similar area that did not. Furthermore, we also provide an econometric analysis that focuses on the integration of value chain actors into modern value chains more broadly defined. We find that dairy value chains are transforming rapidly, but innovations are more pronounced in areas that received the bulk of FDI. Our analysis further underscores the importance of milk collection centers, which often take the form of farmer cooperatives, in providing many of the support services that enable other actors in the value chain to produce sufficient milk, and maintain milk sanitation levels necessary for a modern export sector to emerge. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Mainland Southeast Asia has become an increasingly important source for Chinese imports of fresh fruit. But how have these activities contributed to patterns of regional development in sites of production? This paper uses insights from China-centric melon production in Myanmar to generate new insights into this question. We argue that the expansion of this trade has created a structural form of strategic coupling in which benefits have flowed to a relatively small number of participants. Whereas these outcomes have some similarities to fresh fruit and vegetable export chains elsewhere in the world, what makes this case special is their creation through a form of value chain governance quite unlike the retailer-led arrangements typically associated with export fresh fruit and vegetable production. In the Myanmar-China melons trade, brokers, not retailers, exercise lead firm functions. These arrangements have generated distinctive and highly uneven distributions of risk and reward that have inhibited value chain upgrading and created substantial environmental despoliation. The vulnerabilities associated with these processes were brought into sharp relief with the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020, which led to local farmers bearing huge costs and debts when the border trade was abruptly curtailed. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Mineral processing production of non-ferrous metal mines are the focus of mining enterprise management. The analysis of mineral processing production and operations management mode are helpful to find the problems and improvement methods in production management, and are of great significance to improve production efficiency and quality. Combined with the type and characteristics of non-ferrous metal mineral processing production, with the modern production and operations management methods, this paper makes an in-depth analysis on the methods of production and operations management of non-ferrous metal mineral processing from six aspects:demand and production prediction,comprehensive production planning, production operation planning and control, inventory management, production resource consumption and planning management and production quality management. It is found that the methods of mineral processing production and operations management are relatively extensive at present,there is a lack of informatization in many links, the statistical period of production data is long, the flow of management information is not smooth,and the work-site production decision-making mainly depends on people. The group company can not grasp the production situation in real time and can not effectively implement the collaborative management of the industrial chain. However, under the background of the further development of information technology, there is space for improvement in the production and operations management of mineral processing. A future mineral processing production and operations management conception is made from the perspectives of mining group,concentrator and production process. It is stated that the production and operations management efficiency could be improved due to IT architecture of "cloud-edge" »integration of value-chain,upgrading of factory-level informatization and innovation of mineral processing technology. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Data on four different case studies in Lithuania is analysed to answer this question. Results indicate that building endogenous technological capacity through a variety of business-university collaboration types is needed to attract higher-value foreign direct investment and facilitate intersectoral and functional global value chain upgrading.

	abstract = {This paper describes the impacts of and responses to COVID-19 of small-scale fisheries in six selected countries in Southeast Asia, including Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam. The paper used a structured case study approach to analyse the impacts and responses and relied heavily on existing reports and data sources in each country. The pandemic has further revealed the vulnerability of small-scale fishing households in the region. Given the few assets of fisher households, their ability to cushion the negative impact of crises and shocks is limited. Fishers made adaptive responses such as direct fish marketing, online marketing, and home delivery services. While short-term responses of providing food and financial assistance have been helpful, long-term support to address pandemics such as COVID-19 and other stressors will require developing more resilient fishing households. The paper recommends several approaches and interventions to improve household resilience and to be better prepared for similar challenges and threats in the future. These include: i) strengthening the fishing households’ social network of friends, relatives, and neighbours to serve as both a social safety net and a bridge towards the transition to financial inclusion; ii) diversifying livelihood to reduce dependency on the fishery and provide for additional sources of income and food; iii) promoting financial inclusion through savings, credit, digital payment products, and insurance; iv) value chain upgrading through post-harvest fish handling and processing methods; and, v) providing access, especially for women, to social protection measures such as government health insurance and social security. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This paper identifies, characterises and analyses six evolving regenerative business (RM) models in the UK based on 10 cases we studied. Our conceptual framework extracts four key elements from contemporary business model and value chain literature; architecture/structure, value creation and extraction, networks and linkages, and governance. Using the case study method, we identified the following business models: materials and service provision; early exit: Phase I/II; manufacturing and scale up; translational services; virtual; and integrated. All the business models are still pre-revenue, except for manufacturing and scale up which generates revenue from contract manufacturing therapies for clinical trials. The RM sector is still evolving and consequently the business models are still in flux. Two key challenges for the sector are scalability and sustainability, which creates challenges for pre-emptive policy and practice interventions. We conclude that pre-emptive policy design should support value chain upgrading, paying particular attention to short, medium and long-term sustainability of the RM innovation eco-system, especially evolution of a broad base of SMEs that can take over when public funding is withdrawn. A proportionate and adaptive regulatory environment will be critical to supporting evolving business models even as value chain upgrading occurs. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Improving forest product value chains is considered a means to solve forest-related challenges in the Global South. The ‘Participative Innovation Platform’ (PIP) instrument has been developed to design and to continually adapt solutions and strategies for effective cooperation amongst value chain actors. The instrument is rooted in the action-oriented and social learning approach, combined with the concept of innovation systems. This paper presents findings from three PIPs conducted for upgrading non-timber forest product value chains in Ethiopia (bamboo, natural gums) and Sudan (gum Arabic). A comparative analysis of highest ranked contents revealed similarities in the challenges: lack of government support, poor infrastructure, producers’ lack of knowledge and skills, and lack of market information. Priority upgrading measures focused on producers’ knowledge, skills, and capacity to engage in collective action and to lobby interests, and on capital resources to invest in processing technology. It is concluded that although the PIP instrument presents an innovative way to upgrade forest-based value chains, the instrument requires a long-term process with frequently held platform meetings, conducted by neutral institutions with skilled moderators. Crucial in this process is the need to consistently verify and ensure that all actor groups of the chain are represented, and are confident they will derive benefits from the value chain upgrading. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Since the implementation of the reform and opening up policy, driven by the export- oriented developmental pattern, China has deeply joined the globalization process and quickly realized industrial upgrading. However, since the beginning of the twenty-first century, China's manufacturing industry has faced many crises and challenges such as rising costs and institutional changes. In response to these challenges, China's manufacturing industry has begun a new round of industrial upgrading, which fundamentally reshapes the industrial space and organizational structure of the manufacturing industry, changing the function, role, and influence of China's manufacturing in regional and global export markets. Focusing on industrial upgrading, this article first reviewed the research on industrial upgrading pattern, and divided it into industrial value chain upgrading and spatial upgrading. Then, it examined the industrial upgrading mechanism from multiple scales: Global, national, regional, local, and enterprise, and drew the following main conclusions: 1) Value chain upgrading and spatial upgrading are two sides of industrial upgrading. Value chain upgrading focuses on organizational restructuring, and spatial upgrading emphasizes geographical restructuring. Spatial upgrading has four types: Localization, delocalization, relocalization, and regionalization, which are coupling and interacting with value chain upgrading. An analysis framework combining both can comprehensively reflect the status of industrial upgrading in China. 2) Considering the complex and diverse upgrading phenomena in China, the existing literature on industrial upgrading pattern is relatively simple, and it is necessary to pay more attention to the cross-upgrading path and the non-linear, complex, and diverse nature of China's industrial upgrading in the future. 3) China's industrial upgrading process is driven by the forces from multiple scales of global, national, regional, local, and enterprise. We propose a multi- scale integration perspective that abandons singleperspective, top- down, and hierarchical ways of thinking. Using the multi- scale analysis framework to investigate the upgrading mechanisms can help us to better understand the development and the catching up path of China's industry. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Commercialization of cassava is increasing because of increased urban demand for processed products and increased recognition of the industrial potential of the crop. This study aims to examine the cassava value chain in Ghana and its implications for upgrading. Design/methodology/approach: A combination of purposive, simple random and snowball sampling methods was adopted to select key actors in the cassava value chain. A semi-structured questionnaire was used to collect primary data. Analysis of the data was largely descriptive, except for profitability of cassava production in selected regions, which was examined by employing gross and net marketing margin analysis. A comprehensive value chain map was generated to show the different product pathways for cassava from the farm gate to the final consumer, and roles of key value chain actors and their relationships were summarized through simple narrations. Findings: Evidence has shown chains of more than four different channels through which fresh cassava roots move from the farm gate to final consumers. Production of cassava in Ghana is profitable, generating positive net marketing margins across major producing centres. Processing of cassava has both dry and wet/fresh value chains depending on the derived products for the final consumer. There is weak governance system in the cassava value chain in Ghana as majority of actors use spot market transactions in dealing with trading partners. The use of standardized grading and weighing system is very limited in the chain, and limited access to credit is a critical constraint to value chain upgrading. Research limitations/implications: With the exception of results from the profitability analysis of producers, the findings on marketing margins of other value chain actors may not be generalizable. Future studies could determine the profitability associated with cassava value-adding activities like processing into various forms and explore the possibility of converting waste from processing into energy. Practical implications: The study includes implications that focus on product and process upgrading efforts by smallholders in the cassava value chain. This paper recommends innovative financing models for smallholders to improve access to microcredit via internal and external funding sources. Originality/value: This paper reveals specific intervention areas in which smallholders can direct efforts in an attempt to improve the cassava value chain through product, process and functional upgrading. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The level of agricultural productivity in Sub-Saharan Africa remains far below the global average. This is partly due to the scarce use of production-and process-enhancing technologies. This study aims to explore the driving forces and effects of adopting innovative agricultural technologies in food value chains (FVC). These enhancing FVC technologies are referred to as upgrading strategies (UPS) and are designed to improve specific aspects of crop production, postharvest processing, market interaction, and consumption. Based on cross-sectional data collected from 820 Tanzanian farm households, this study utilized the adaptive lasso to analyse the determinants of UPS. To measure the impact of their adoption on well-being, this study applied the propensity score matching approach (PSM). Results from the adaptive lasso suggested that access to credit, experience of environmental shocks and social capital were the main drivers of UPS adoption. In contrast, the engagement in off-farm wage employment impeded adoption. The results from the PSM suggested that UPS adoption has a positive and significant impact on well-being among sampled households, especially with respect to their total value of durable goods and commercialization. The paper suggests that the promotion of social capital and access to financial capital is pivotal in enhancing the adoption of innovative UPS in the farming sector. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Following the food price crisis in 2008, African governments implemented policies aiming at crowding in investment in rice value chain upgrading to help domestic rice compete with imports. We assess the state of rice value chain upgrading in West Africa by reviewing evidence on rice millers’ investment in semi-industrial and industrial milling technologies, contract farming and vertical integration during the post-crisis period 2009–2019. We find that upgrading is more dynamic in countries with high rice production and import bills and limited comparative advantage in demand. However, scaling of upgrading faces several challenges in terms of vertical coordination, technology, finance and policies. Our assessment can help value chain actors and policy makers refine upgrading strategies and policies to increase food security in West Africa. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Upgrading in global value chains (GVCs) is an important path for developing countries to move along to capture higher benefits. Several qualitative studies of GVCs have identified two main upgrading types: economic (product, process, functional, and inter-sectoral) and social upgrading. The upgrading concept is widespread in productive sectors such as processed food, which has become a key export for developing countries. However, they have confronted multiple product standards required by global buyers. This study uses a case study of Thailand's processed food exports (TPFEs). Although Thailand is a leading exporter of processed food, the country needs to upgrade in many areas related to production to meet global product standards and requirements. If Thailand fails to comply with global product standards, it will lose its export competitiveness. This study uses a gravity model to evaluate the impact of economic and social upgrading (EUP and SUP) on TPFEs. Our results show that upgrading types are significant in TPFEs, particularly for exports to developed countries. Process upgrading has a negative impact on TPFEs because of increased production costs to comply with product standards. However, process upgrading can lead to increased producers’ and exporters’ knowledge about how to comply with international standards. Consequently, process upgrading exhibits a lagged positive effect on TPFEs. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

This reflects the importance of non-fabrication activities (services in nature) in goods' value chains, which are more intensive in value and knowledge than fabrication tasks. Functional upgrading involves specialisation in these activities, usually identified with supporting business functions. In this chapter, we first analyse the evolution of Mode 5 services jobs and salaries in the EU, grouped by business function, and then we assess whether there are signs of functional upgrading and how it affects female jobs and the gender pay gap. Our results seem to confirm a decrease in the share of fabrication jobs in favour of management and administration, information technology and other services, which might reflect a process of functional upgrading with side benefits in the form of increased female jobs and reductions in the gender pay gap. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

We held a participatory workshop as part of ongoing research in the town of Lambert's Bay, South Africa, in collaboration with small-scale fishers and the Abalobi ICT project. We mapped fisher value chain challenges and explored the role of ICT-driven transformation pathways, adoptingWright's 'Real Utopian' framework as the lens through which to explore equality, democracy and institutional sustainability. We found Abalobi's ICT platform had the potential to facilitate deeper meanings of democracy that incorporate socio-economic reform, collective action and institutional sustainability in South Africa's small-scale fisheries.

Focusing on synergies between the commodity-producing and related manufacturing and service sectors, value chain interventions assume that buyer-supplier linkages facilitate the upgrading of local industries. This study investigates these synergistic assumptions in the context of the Ivorian cashew industry. The Ivorian case exemplifies how the value chain concept, with its associated focus on local-global linkages, has placed collaboration with foreign lead firms at the heart of the industrial policy agenda. While these collective arrangements are crucial for negotiating inter-firm relationships along global value chains, this study finds little evidence that they have initiated upgrading for local industries. Instead, the emergence of foreign buyers as strategic partners for policy-makers has created opportunities for these lead actors to reinforce their dominant position, stemming from access to finance and technology. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Indian coffee is primarily an export-oriented commodity with over 75% of the annual production being exported to various destinations around the world. Small coffee growers dominates coffee production in the country. The main objective of the study is to estimate the operational cost involved in the production of Robusta coffee and also to estimate the price spread between the coffee growers at farm gate level and at exporters level. The results of the study indicates that, there is a huge price spread (` 34,147 per ton) in coffee value chain due to the inability of the small coffee growers to ship their coffee directly to export destinations which is caused by a number of impediments like low bargaining power associated with fragmented production, lack of trade knowledge, lack of capital and information barriers. Thus, it is important to provide visionary long run sustainable solutions to micro level weakness and threats by considering strengths and opportunities of small coffee growers in the country to move up in the value chain. The results of the study also indicates that, there is huge potential for the coffee growers to enhance their gross income from existing ` 94,900 per acre to ` 1,29,047 per ton by moving up in the value chain. The study also highlighted the initiatives taken by the Coffee Board to support small coffee growers to move up in the value chain. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {With the spread of sustainable thinking, people have come to recognize that profitability is not the only element for the long-term success of businesses. Of equal importance is the issue of the use of natural resources and people's living conditions. Within this realization, consumers' interest in knowing the implications of their consumption is increasing through information on how products and services are produced. This increasingly leads organizations to seek to differentiate their brands through Voluntary Sustainability Standards (VSS). In this context, the aim of this paper is to present a taxonomy of value chain upgrading types through VSS adoption by farmers. Empirical evidence to test the proposed framework is presented focusing on the adoption of the 4C system by coffee farmers in Brazil. Although all five types of upgrading were identified in the field research, most of the improvements can be characterized as environmental. Furthermore, the results indicated that the adoption of the 4C standards was an upgrading form for farmers to enhance the coffee production process, as well as to control management activities within the production unit. The paper is innovative in integrating and proposing a framework for the value chain by adding value through VSS. It also empirically applies the proposed framework in the context of the Brazilian coffee chain. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Background: Quality is a powerful engine in rice value chain upgrading. However, there is no consensus on how “rice quality” should be defined and measured in the rice sector. Scope and approach: We adopt a Lancasterian definition of rice quality as a bundle of intrinsic and extrinsic attributes. We then review how rice quality is (i) perceived and defined by consumers and industry stakeholders in rice value chains in Southeast and South Asia; (ii) measured and defined by food technologists; and (iii) predicted through genetics. Key findings and conclusions: Consumers are heterogeneous with respect to their perceived differentiation of rice quality among regions, countries, cities, and urbanization levels. Premium quality is defined by nutritional benefits, softness and aroma in Southeast Asia, and by the physical appearance of the grains (uniformity, whiteness, slenderness), satiety, and aroma in South Asia. These trends are found to be consistent with industry perceptions and have important implications for regional and national breeding programs in terms of tailoring germplasm to regions and rice varieties to specific local market segments. Because rice is traded internationally, there is a need to standardize definitions of rice quality. However, food technologists have not reached unanimity on quality classes and measurement; routine indicators need to be complemented by descriptive profiles elicited through sensory evaluation panels. Finally, because rice quality is controlled by multiple interacting genes expressed through environmental conditions, predicting grain quality requires associating genetic information with grain quality phenotypes in different environments. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Deciphering how to upgrade Chinese enterprises' positions in the global value chain is crucial to China's economic transformation and sustainable development. This study explores the feasibility of upgrading China's global value chain from the perspective of financial constraints. Based on a theoretical framework, this study applies firm-level production data and trade data, using a documented method of measuring domestic value added at the firm level. Besides, we apply three methods to comprehensively measure the financial constraints faced by enterprises. In our study, we verify the findings of previous empirical studies that reducing financial constraints can significantly increase enterprises' domestic value added, and this conclusion remains valid after considering various robustness tests. Our heterogeneity analysis indicates that easing financial constraints can significantly contribute to Chinese private enterprises' upgrade in the global value chain, which could be related with "ownership discrimination" of Chinese banks. Finally, this study analyses the two mechanisms by which relaxing financial constraints could promote global value chain upgrading: (i) directly transfer enterprises' trade mode from processing trade to general trade and (ii) allowing enterprises to climb up in the global value chain. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The Vietnamese government is currently attempting to upgrade rice value chains in the Mekong River Delta by encouraging (i) vertical coordination between exporters and farmers through contract farming, and (ii) horizontal coordination among farmers through the “small farmers, large field” program. Previous studies on the determinants of contract farming participation assume that firms offer only a single contract type, whereas in reality, farmers may face a continuum of exclusive contract options. Devising correct and targeted policies for fostering contract inclusiveness hence crucially hinges on deploying correct econometric specification of the decision to participate in contract farming. We model contract farming participation and intensity in four different ways along the vertical coordination continuum: as a discrete, categorical, ordered, and continuous choice. We find that older, smaller and horizontally coordinated farmers with higher levels of trust in buyers tend to secure higher levels of buyer investment through increased vertical coordination. In contrast with the common finding in the literature that contract participation is biased towards larger farms, our findings from Vietnam suggest that the scale bias of contract farming could be successfully relaxed through horizontal coordination and even reversed under increasing levels of vertical coordination as smaller farmers are found to secure higher levels of buyer investment. These findings highlight the role both policies can play in fostering inclusiveness of contract farming in rice value chain upgrading in Vietnam. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {One of the most promising ways to mitigate climate change is through “agriculture and landscape climate solutions”: the conservation, restoration and improved management of agriculture and natural land in order to increase carbon storage and/or avoid greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in landscapes worldwide. In this perspective, the agriculture sector is facing a wide rethinking on the way to better integrate environment and climate change issues into agriculture policies. Schools of thinking towards sustainable agriculture and agroecology are competing with new concepts such as sustainable land management, climate-smart agriculture and low-carbon agriculture. On the other hand, policymakers and donors face the issue of integration of mitigation and adaptation in agriculture policies and investment programmes. New performance indicators such as carbon footprint and carbon balance are used to select value and promote high-performing options. Similarly, food markets progressively provide products with reduced carbon footprint. Implementing such new and marketing mechanisms slowly induce a progressive transformation of the food value chains, agriculture policies and incentives. However, high inertia does remain in the agricultural sector, slowing down the switch towards real low-carbon agriculture options. This chapter does analyse a series of shortcuts used by countries and donors to stimulate such structural change, considering appropriate appraising tools, new incentive mechanisms, new modalities of funding and acting with scaling-up perspectives. Agroforestry value chains upgrading scenarios such as cocoa or shea parkland restoration are provided as examples of upscaling paths with high-carbon-fixing performances.The issues covered in this chapter include “environmental policy”, “sustainable agriculture”, “climate-smart agriculture”, “climate mitigation and adaptation”, “global food policy” and “low-carbon agriculture”. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Results show that general upgrading actions are associated with improved producer prices, and specific activities, such as seeking information from reputable sources can lead to substantial welfare improvements. The paper goes beyond most value chain studies which treat participation in a ‘modern’ value chain as a discrete state. Ecuador's blackberry industry is evolving incrementally with no clearly discernible ‘modern’ market chains. Instead, producers incrementally make improvements in multiple dimensions. Relatively low-cost practices, many of which do not imply substantial risk or investment, are associated with price improvements. Obstacles to participation in incremental value chain upgrading activities are not insurmountable. In particular, scale of production is not a limiting factor: small-scale producers are not precluded from adopting improved practices and they do not suffer in terms of price received. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Value chain upgrading interventions have emerged in recent years as a dominant approach to rural development. In coffee value chains, upgrading opportunities are presented by the growth in consumption of specialty coffees, which are associated with direct engagement with producer communities by roasting firms, along with an apparent increased commitment to social responsibility. Known in the industry as “relationship coffee”, such interventions align with a value chain approach to development and are promoted as offering upgrading opportunities for otherwise marginalized rural communities. In this article, we critique the dominant development discourse of relationship coffee in Indonesia via three case studies of livelihoods and local agrarian dynamics across three coffee-growing communities on the islands of Sulawesi, Bali and Java. We find that the relationship coffee model does present opportunities for producer upgrading. However, these benefits have been subsequently captured by key individuals within the producer community who are able to accumulate wealth and consolidate their social position. As it is currently implemented in Indonesia, the relationship coffee model has reproduced local patterns of inequality rather than contributing to poverty alleviation efforts. These insights suggest the urgent need to develop a critical political economy of upgrading in the global value chain and rural development literature. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

This tends to deflect narratives that relate to systemic inequalities and the mechanisms by which those inequalities are reproduced. We seek to remedy that defect in two ways. First, we demonstrate that assumptions in GVC analysis about the distribution of value creation along the chain, which are generally adopted to support value chain ‘upgrading’ as a policy prescription, may be unreliable. Second, we combine the analytic with the emerging ‘global wealth chain’ analytic regarding tax outcomes, for this will enable us to map contestation over value capture between capital, labour and the state along the chain. We call this synthetic analytic the ‘global inequality chain’ (GIC). While we deploy Marxian value theory to provide a framework for this schematic mapping exercise, we emphasize that the GIC is amenable to other value-theoretical frameworks (provided such frameworks are objective rather than empirically reliant on realization in the form of prices). We illustrate the utility of the GIC by applying it to the topics of global gender inequality and corporate tax reform. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

This study investigated the gender influence on preferred food and cash crops, as well as upgrading strategies in sub-humid Kilosa and semi-arid Chamwino Districts, Tanzania. A mixed methods research design was used to collect information from 595 respondents, while content analysis was used to qualitatively analyze qualitative data obtained from focus group discussions and key informant interviews. Our findings show that farmers from Kilosa and Chamwino had no differences with respect to preferences expressed by men and women for their first priority cash. Gender differences for choices were evident in relation to the second priority, food crops, in the semi-arid area and the third priority, which was also food crops in the sub-humid area, where women and youth differed from men on their views toward maize versus sorghum in the semi-arid region. Here, youth differed from women and men in how they viewed cassava versus rice. For upgrading strategies, which were only conducted with the first priority crops, most of the strategies preferred by men differed from those preferred by women and youth. In both areas, youth and women preferred upgrading strategies related to crop harvesting, transportation and primary processing, whereas men preferred upgrading strategies for farm inputs and crop marketing. Therefore, it is recommended that site-specific gendered analysis on upgrading strategies in agricultural value chains should be completed prior to introducing an intervention. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Our analysis focuses on the different stages of implementing the 2012 small-scale fisheries policy designed to promote collective action and enable inter alia small-scale rock lobster fishers to improve rights allocation and the terms of their inclusion in export value chains. The results indicate that collective action by fishers is imperative to achieve upgrading by small-scale fishers in value chains, and that constructive and well defined relations with private as well as extra-transactional actors, like government and NGOs, are essential to the success of collective action as an upgrading strategy. By combining insights from interactive governance and global value chain governance we propose a new analytical framework that goes beyond upgrading alone to better understand the influences of collective action and the role of these extra-transactional actors in the development of small-scale fisheries. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Developing countries have an opportunity to create and capture higher value added by participating in global value chains (GVCs). Such potential has spawned recommendations for successive vertical specialisation but the applicability of the strategy in GVCs for agricultural commodities is rarely scrutinised. This paper examines the fundamental question of whether participation and upgrading in agro-commodity value chains conform to vertical specialisation and if not, how and why. The case study on the Malaysian palm oil sector suggests that upgrading is prone to sectoral linkage development and vertical integration at local lead firms. State policies and firm-specific actions since the 1970s drove attainment of capabilities which Malaysia did not possess originally in segments across the value chain for production of more sophisticated goods and services. Unique production characteristics, sectoral dynamics and historical settings of agro-commodity value chains explain the trajectory. The study suggests that vertical specialisation is less applicable across all GVC types than thought, and that development policy and research should delve more into hindrances to linkage development in similar additive value chains. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Value chain upgrading and innovation systems perspectives were combined in an analytical framework to interpret the findings, which show that multi-stakeholder processes enhance horizontal and vertical coordination but limit process and product upgrading. The main conclusion is that, although such processes may catalyze smallholder market inclusion, their effects are largely bounded by existing value chain structures (e.g. production system, fragmented markets), timeframe and how prevailing institutional constraints are addressed, which may constrain the intentions of such collaboration action. This calls attention to the starting points of value chain interventions and the socio-political dynamics that are part of multi-stakeholder processes. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Organized globally and led by trans-national enterprises, global production networks (GPNs) develop rapidly along with the advancement of technology and deepening of trade liberalization. GPN provides great opportunities for developing countries to blend in global economy and realize their technological advance, as well as value chain upgrading. Facing the pressure of shifting model of economic development, China has urgent need of optimizing export trade though she has experienced marvelous success especially on export trade during the past few decades, so that the study on export product upgrading can be particularly important. Based on such consideration, this article focuses on how participating GPN influences China's export product upgrade. This article uses the conception of quality to quantitively describe product upgrade, and we calculate the product quality based on data of customs trade database from 2000 to 2011. The result shows that export product quality presents a declining trend from east to west of China, and the average quality of the whole country fluctuates a lot during 2000- 2011 with a slight rising trend showing up recently. We then build several econometric models to examine whether participating in GPN matters, and how exactly this influence works. The results show that participating in GPN has remarkable influence on export product upgrading especially in eastern China, but market dispersion does not help in product upgrading. We also find that R&D investment cannot promote regional position in global value chain in eastern China, forming a typical "Low-end lock-in". Capitaland technology- intensive products benefit a lot from participating in GPN while labourintensive exports may open markets with low-quality products. Fiscal decentralization is a key determinant in eastern and central provinces, and local governments tend to give more support to technology-intensive product upgrading. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {National rice development strategies in Africa are often supply-focused and implicitly assume that consumers will readily substitute imported for domestic rice. However, due to increasing import dependency, urban consumer preferences for rice have become biased toward Asian export quality standards, against which African rice has difficulties to compete. Anecdotal evidence suggests that this import bias is higher in cities close to the port and remote from the geographical centers of cultural heritage where African rice was domesticated more than 3,000 years ago. We purposely select a sample of five West African urban markets which are supplied by both foreign and domestic rice value chains and which are located at varying distances from the nearest ports and centers of cultural heritage, and conduct framed field experiments based on auctions to analyze the drivers of urban demand for domestic rice with upgraded quality characteristics. We find that West African rice has increasing difficulties competing against imported rice on urban markets the more consumers appreciate characteristics of imported Asian rice, the closer to the port, and the further the geographical and genealogical distance from rice cultural heritage. These challenges provide crucial insights into value chain upgrading in policy makers’ struggle to achieve rice self-sufficiency in West Africa. Our findings suggest that the optimal portfolio of investment in value chain upgrading is a function of the targeted end-market and its distance from the port and rice cultural heritage. The closer the end-market is located toward the port, the more investment is needed in lifting demand of domestic rice through quality upgrading, branding, and promotion to enable it to compete against imported rice. Proximity to centers of cultural heritage, on the other hand, endows rice value chains with a “comparative advantage in demand,” requiring less investment in demand-lifting and leaving more room for supply-shifting investments. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Slaughtered at heavy live weights, carcasses of the autochthonous Vietnamese Ban pig breed are not marketable on the highly remunerative niche markets of the urban Red River Delta. Therefore, Ban pigs are traded often at just 10 to 15 kg to avoid excessive fat accumulation. However, already, a moderate increase of slaughter weights might lead to rising profits for smallholder farmers in the uplands. Thus, this research aimed at investigating the effect of increasing live weight on the carcass composition and meat quality of indigenous Ban pigs qualifying for commerce on high-end markets. Fifty-six castrated male Ban fatteners with body weights ranging from 6.5 to 29.3 kg were collected from smallholder farmers applying a feeding system based on banana pseudostem (Musa spp.) and slaughtered by local slaughterers according to common practice. The carcass quality of 51 animals and, additionally, meat quality parameters of the loin and ham of 56 animals were assessed. For the evaluation of increased live weights on commodity prices, two pricing systems based on actual market prices for Ban fatteners in Son La town and Hanoi were suggested. Carcass fat depots did not significantly increase when body weights were raised from 12 to approximately 20 kg, and the distribution of primal cuts and the meat quality of the loin and ham were relatively stable. Thus, the currently applied slaughter weights for purebred Ban pigs appear to be suboptimal, and a moderate increase of slaughter weights to approximately 20 kg is feasible and could result in monetary benefits. In this context, the role of small-scale slaughterers for value chain upgrading is discussed. In conclusion, increasingly formalized value chains for traditional pork products could provide the potential to not only contribute to rural development in the Southeast Asian Massif, but also to the conservation of animal genetic resources of a highly valuable eco-cultural region. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {In developing economies, well-functioning markets are known to provide the poor with avenues for wealth creation. Using a value chain approach, this paper aims at examining bottlenecks to and opportunities for different categories of women to participate in markets for high value agricultural commodities, with a view to identifying feasible upgrading strategies for the different categories. The findings are based on a case study of Kenya's avocado value chain, which depicts export and domestic market orientation. The data were collected through focus group discussions, key informant interviews, in-depth interviews and household surveys. The results suggest that in the more commercialized and well developed chains like that of export, upgrading strategies vary for the different typologies of women. While women in female headed households may require limited efforts such as tailoring financial products to their needs or providing interlinked services coupled with prompt payment for their produce to allow them to produce quality fruits and access lucrative markets, women in male headed households need institutionalization of gender-sensitive policies in the governance of producer groups to enable them to upgrade as chain integrators and chain owners. In the less commercialized domestic chain, limited efforts may be required to upgrade women along the chain, but the need to change from the less marketable local variety to exotic variety is likely to alter women's position, thereby calling for the need to institutionalize gender-sensitive policies in the governance of existing organized groups and use the groups as a platform to introduce the new variety. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The concept of value chain upgrading and promotion has been proposed as a vehicle for small-holder farmers in developing countries to gain access to higher value markets and thus generate greater income for their families and communities. However, there are many instances where investments in upgrading have not generated the expected outcomes. One of the contributing factors has been that existing approaches focus more on who does what rather than the real problem to be addressed. A chain failure framework on the other hand focuses attention on the core problem and the appropriate response, rather than on who does what. It takes a system view rather than a function or component view, and it starts from the supposition that the only reason for intervening in a value chain is to increase chain surplus, where chain surplus is properly measured to include any chain or social externalities. In this paper we review some of the existing literature on value chain upgrading and promotion as proposed for developing country situations, outline the essential elements of the chain failure/chain good theory and its relationship to the club goods literature, and then assess whether the chain upgrading and promotion literature can be reconfigured as a chain failure/chain good problem, using a number of published case studies. Finally, we discuss various types of governance models used in agricultural value chains in developing countries and suggest how well they might align with the chain failure/chain good approach. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Data was collected through focus group discussions with farmers, stacked surveys with rice value chain stakeholders, and a participatory workshop bringing several value chain actors together. Stakeholders perceive the sector's capability to grasp opportunities (including growing export and domestic markets) to be higher than its resilience to potential threats (including more stringent food safety regulations and climate change). Three strategies are discussed for making rice value chains more sustainable; embodying sustainability in the product through certified sustainable production labels; internalizing sustainable production standards through vertical coordination (e.g., contract farming); and disembodying sustainability through book and claim certificate trading. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Eco-efficiency has been widely recognized during the last two decades as a suitable measure of a given system's progress towards a greener and sustainable development. It combines the economic welfare and the ecological impact of products or services throughout their lifecycle. The need for improving eco-efficiency leads to the development of appropriate metrics for measuring the performance of a given system and the identification of the most promising alternative solutions (eco-innovations). This paper briefly presents a methodological framework for the eco-efficiency assessment of water-use systems, using a life-cycle oriented approach and a set of selected eco-efficiency indicators. The environmental performance of the system is evaluated through the relevant midpoint environmental impact categories, while the economic performance is measured using the total value added to the system's final product due to water use. The proposed framework is applied to the textile industry in Biella, Italy. The analysis reveals that the major environmental problems of the textile industry in the region are freshwater resource depletion, as well as human toxicity and ecotoxicity (both aquatic and terrestrial). The identification of the environmentally weak stages of the system has led to the selection of alternative actions, which could upgrade the whole value chain and improve the overall eco-efficiency. Six innovative technologies are examined and two alternative technology scenarios are formulated. The first scenario focuses on resource efficiency, while the second one focuses on reducing the emissions to water. The results show that all technologies could potentially improve the majority of the environmental performance indicators of the system. However, the scenario towards pollution prevention and control has proven to be not economically viable due to the high investment cost required and the current economic conditions, while the implementation of the scenario towards resource efficiency requires additional economic incentives and governmental support in order to be considered feasible by the industrial stakeholders. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

We review historical evidence and survey urban consumers across 24 cities in seven Asian countries to assess heterogeneity and trends of consumer preferences for intrinsic attributes of rice.

Critics, however, argue that CF is likely to pass risks to small scale farmers, thus favouring large scale farmers at the expense of smallholder farmers. The purpose of this paper is to examine the effect of CF on smallholder farmers’ income using a case study of avocado farmers in Kandara district in Kenya. Design/methodology/approach – The study uses data collected from 100 smallholder avocado farmers in Kandara district in Kenya and employs an instrumental variable model (Probit-2SLS) to control for endogeneity in participation in the contract and examine the effect of CF on household, farm and avocado income. Findings – The results indicate that participation in CF is not sufficient to improve household, farm and avocado income. Question remains regarding efficient implementation of CF arrangements to promote spill over effects on other household enterprises. Research limitations/implications – The research was carried out using farmers in Kandara district in Kenya as a case study, findings might therefore not reflect the status of CF in all countries. Originality/value – The paper contributes to the growing debate on the effect of value chain upgrading strategies such as contracting on smallholder farmers’ welfare. The form of contracting studied in this paper differs from the standard contracts in that the key stakeholders (producers) are loosely enjoined in the contract through officials of their groups. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Local conditions in developing countries have long played a part in determining whether their small-scale firms can benefit from deepening their participation in global value chains (GVCs). Institutional theory allows us to characterize these local conditions not simply as particularistic oddities but rather as elements of an institutional matrix that affects the livelihoods of chain participants. However, the institutional dimension of GVC analysis has been traditionally neglected in the literature, to the detriment of our understanding of the impacts of upgrading in GVCs. This study aims to remedy this failure by illustrating how institutional context mediates between value chain upgrading and the livelihoods of chain participants. It particular, it seeks to elucidate how value chain upgrading spurs a process of change in the institutions that govern the livelihoods of suppliers in developing countries. This examination sheds light on the more general question of how value chain upgrading sometimes helps, but sometimes hurts, the welfare of chain participants. This theoretical contribution to the value chain literature is based upon an institutional analysis of primary qualitative data from more than 80 small-scale tea farmers in Nepal, some of whom had upgraded from conventional to organically certified production. Our study finds that value chain upgrading launches a process of institutional change that can be summarized in a general typology. The typology highlights how rules, strategies, organizations, and informal norms affect whether a given upgrading intervention yields livelihood benefits in a particular place. Upgrading can yield positive impacts in chain-linked livelihood dimensions, such as price, and yet induce negative changes in other livelihood dimensions, such as risk, and thereby yield overall adverse livelihood implications, in a process we dub “immiserizing upgrading”. These findings contribute to advancing the conceptual literature on global value chains (GVCs) by suggesting a general typology for cycles of institutional change that influence livelihood outcomes. The typology provides a framework to analyze such processes that is also of use to development practitioners seeking to understand the conditions under which upgrading worsens or improves the welfare of value chain participants. The research findings provide an interesting window into how certification schemes interact with the daily lives of the rural poor. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Partly as a result of historical urban bias, African countries have become heavily dependent on food imports with concomitant risks for food security as witnessed during the 2008 food crisis. African governments now recognize that they should reverse urban bias by investing in agriculture in order to decrease food import dependency. However, they typically focus primarily on supply-shifting investments that may be insufficient to render domestically produced food competitive, particularly in import-biased food markets. We review the national rice development investment strategies of 19 African countries and argue that in order to reverse urban bias in African rice markets, more resources will need to be allocated to value-adding and demand-lifting investments. © 2013 Elsevier B.V. © 2013 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Two main positions currently shape this debate: one that argues the payment of 'above market' prices will promote reliance by Southern producers on low value agricultural production; another that fair trade might actually alleviate barriers to diversification and facilitate export opportunities. Responding to a lack of empirically grounded literature, the paper focuses on involvement by the National Smallholder Farmers' Association of Malawi (NASFAM) with two dedicated fair trade marketing networks. Based on qualitative case study research, analysis shows that dedicated fair trade organisations have played a significant role in promoting export diversification: particularly through the facilitation of market access and provision of the financial, social and physical capital needed to support such changes. Beyond this however, the study also highlights the importance and limitations of 'moral geographies' that permeate the construction of ethical credentials beneficial to the international marketing of Southern export producers in Northern consumer markets. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. © 2013 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The dessert banana sector in Central America is divided into two main production and marketing systems, with large-scale producers of Cavendish (AAA) bananas supplying export markets, and smallholders producing mainly 'Gros Michel' (AAA) interplanted in coffee plantations for local and national markets. This study presents an overview of banana value chains for smallholders in Nicaragua and Honduras, analyzing profits for farmers and options for upgrading. The 'Gros Michel' value chains in Nicaragua and Honduras differ primarily in that Nicaraguan value chains concentrate on national markets, while Honduran trade includes regional value chains to Guatemala and El Salvador. Two main types of national value chains were identified in Nicaragua: (i) a local chain, where farmers transport small amounts of bananas and sell them directly to wholesalers in the district capital where they are sold locally, and (ii) a longer chain with intermediaries buying at farm gate, followed by bulking, transport, ripening businesses, wholesalers, retailers directed to consumers in the country's capital. Although in the longer chain, the share of the final price received by the farmers is lower, farmer profits are slightly higher due to a higher consumer price and lower farmer investments in transport. In Honduras, farmers usually sell at the farm gate. Depending on farm accessibility, bananas are sold to intermediaries or directly to traders who export them to Guatemala or El Salvador, with only 25% of the production sold on national markets. Several options for upgrading were identified in both countries. Process upgrading for improved fruit quality and efficient organization of transport is a basic option for all sites. Upgrading through improved coordination with traditional buyers and intermediaries who expressed their willingness to deal directly with farmers and pay higher prices for higher quality fruits might be feasible in the short term. In the longer term, options include contracts with supermarkets, possibly combined with branding of the bananas based on consumer preferences for traditionally produced 'Gros Michel'. In general, transport is a major limitation for receiving higher prices due to remoteness of the farms in coffee-growing highland areas. For the more formal contract-based market chains, requirements of minimum quantities and timing of supply imply that substantial investments in farmer organization will be necessary. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Upgrading is a key concept for value chain analysis and refers to the acquisition of technological capabilities and market linkages that enable firms to improve their competitiveness and move into higher-value activities. The authors examine a range of evidence to assess whether the 'bottom billion' people, living mainly in the rural areas of low-income countries, can improve their position through productive strategies and, if so, how? They propose an innovative conceptual framework of value chain upgrading for some of the most marginal producers in the poorest local economies. They demonstrate how interventions can improve poverty and the environment for poor people supplying a wide range of services and agricultural and food products to local, regional and global markets. This analysis is based on empirical research conducted in Senegal, Mali, Tanzania, India, Nepal, Philippines and Vietnam. The main focus is on poverty, environment and gender outcomes of upgrading interventions, and represents one of the key challenges of contemporary development economics. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Finally, upgrading options are defined in the area of value addition, including the search for markets, the value chain- network structure and the governance form of the chain. Part of this component is the identification of the most suitable partnerships for upgrading the value chain.

While developed countries consume the vast majority of global services, demand from developing economies and new end markets is beginning to grow. Supply is dominated by India, which in 2009 had 45% of the global market share for offshore services. Indian firms occupy most value chain segments and they have expanded in the South to serve both domestic and export markets. Although the quality and quantity of human capital remains the key factor in the location of offshore services, formal education is being supplemented by demand-driven training and compliance with required international professional certifications and performance standards.

The pharmaceutical industry in Uganda consists of a large number of importers, nine of which have upgraded into assembly and four a step further into manufacturing. The industry upgrades by a process of 'learning by importing'. Although not engaged with global buyers, pharmaceutical producers in Uganda are tied into the global pharmaceutical value chain by international linkages with their suppliers, mainly in India, from whom they access technology and intermediates for production. Hence, this industry is based on South South networks for production of low-value pharmaceutical products. With the globalisation of the pharmaceutical industry, an increasing number of global lead firms are ceasing to manufacture these products.
